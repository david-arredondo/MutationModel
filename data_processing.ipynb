It is involved in cell adhesion, cell morphology, thrombosis, cell migration, and embryonic differentiation. Fibronectin is a modular protein composed of homologous repeats of three prototypical types of domains known as types I, II, and III. Fibronectin type-III (FN3) repeats are both the largest and the most common of the fibronectin subdomains. Domains homologous to FN3 repeats have been found in various animal protein families including other extracellular-matrix molecules, cell-surface receptors, enzymes, and muscle proteins. Structures of individual FN3 domains have revealed a conserved β-sandwich fold with one β-sheet containing four strands and the other sheet containing three strands (see for example ). This fold is topologically very similar to that of Ig-like domains, with a notable difference being the lack of a conserved disulfide bond in FN3 domains. Distinctive hydrophobic core packing and the lack of detectable sequence homology between immunoglobulin and FN3 domains suggest, however, that these domains are not evolutionarily related. FN3 exhibits functional as well as structural modularity. Sites of interaction with other molecules have been mapped to short stretch of amino acids such as the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence found in various FN3 domains. The RGD sequences is involved in interactions with integrin. Small peptides containing the RGD sequence can modulate a variety of cell adhesion invents associated with thrombosis, inflammation, and tumour metastasis. These properties have led to the investigation of RGD peptides and RGD peptide analogues as potential therapeutic agents.; IL-7Ralpha, fibronectin type III domain: This domain is found in Interleukin-7 receptor subunit alpha (IL-7Ralpha), which together IL-7 form a complex crucial to several signalling cascades leading to the development and homeostasis of T and B cells. IL-7Ralpha carries a 219 residue ectodomain on the N-terminal region which is crucial for T and B-cell development. Mutations in the IL-7Ralpha ectodomain inhibits T and B cell development, resulting in patients with a form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The ectodomain folds into two fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains connected by a 310-helical linker. This entry comprises the first of the two FNIII domains, D1. In the D1 domain of IL-7Ralpha, a disulfide bond (C22R-C37R) conserved among cytokine receptor class I (CRH I) family members bridges two β strands.; Immunoglobulin-like fold: This superfamily represents domains with an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) fold, which consists of a β-sandwich of seven or more strands in two sheets with a Greek-key topology. Ig-like domains are one of the most common protein modules found in animals, occurring in a variety of different proteins. These domains are often involved in interactions, commonly with other Ig-like domains via their β-sheets. Domains within this fold-family share the same structure, but can diverge with respect to their sequence. Based on sequence, Ig-like domains can be classified as V-set domains (antibody variable domain-like), C1-set domains (antibody constant domain-like), C2-set domains, and I-set domains (antibody intermediate domain-like). Proteins can contain more than one of these types of Ig-like domains. For example, in the human T-cell receptor antigen CD2, domain 1 (D1) is a V-set domain, while domain 2 (D2) is a C2-set domain, both domains having the same Ig-like fold. Domains with an Ig-like fold can be found in many, diverse proteins in addition to immunoglobulin molecules. For example, Ig-like domains occur in several different types of receptors (such as various T-cell antigen receptors), several cell adhesion molecules, MHC class I and II antigens, as well as the hemolymph protein hemolin, and the muscle proteins titin, telokin and twitchin.; Short hematopoietin receptor, family 1, conserved site: A number of receptors for lymphokines, hematopoietic growth factors and growth hormone-related molecules have been found to share a common binding domain. These receptors are designated as hematopoietin receptors and the corresponding ligands as hematopoietins. Further, hematopoietins have been subdivided into two major structural groups: Large/long and small/short hematopoietins. One subset of individual receptor chains that are part of receptor complexes for small hematopoietins are structurally related such that their extracellular parts strictly contain the 200 amino-acids hematopoietin domain (duplicated in IL-3/-5/GM-CSF beta chain receptors KH97/AIC2B and AIC2A). They define a structural subgroup containing the following chains: Interleukin-2 receptor beta chain (IL2RB), Interleukin-2 receptor common gamma chain (IL2RG), Interleukin-3 receptor beta chain (AIC2A), Interleukin-3/-5/GM-CSF receptor common beta chain (KH97/AIC2B), Interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain (IL4RA), Interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain (IL7RA), Interleukin-9 receptor alpha chain (IL9RA).",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in APC; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Familial adenomatous polyposis 1; Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) family: Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a tumor suppressor protein that induces the degradation of oncogenic beta-catenin and negatively regulates Wnt signalling. It has roles in regulating cell migration, DNA replication/repair, mitosis and apoptosis. APC regulates cell-cell adhesion and cell migration through activating the APC-stimulated guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF; Asef). It acts as a mediator of ERBB2-dependent stabilisation of microtubules at the cell cortex. It is required for the localisation of MACF1/ACF7 to the cell membrane and this localisation of MACF1/ACF7 is critical for its function in microtubule stabilisation. APC mutations are particularly prevalent in colorectal cancer. The adenomatous polyposis coli protein family also includes APC2 and APC-related protein 1.; Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) repeat: Adenomatous polyposis coli contains an armadillo repeat and uses its highly conserved surface groove to recognize the APC-binding region (ABR) of Asef. This entry represents a single repeat unit of the Armadillo region.; Adenomatous polyposis coli protein basic domain: This region of the APC family of proteins is known as the basic domain. It contains a high proportion of positively charged amino acids and interacts with microtubules.; Adenomatous polyposis coli protein repeat: This short region is found repeated in the mid region of the adenomatous polyposis proteins (APCs). In the human protein many cancer-linked SNPs are found near the first three occurrences of the motif. These repeats bind beta-catenin.; Adenomatous polyposis coli protein, 15 residue repeat: The 15 aa repeat is found in the APC protein family. It is involved in binding beta-catenin along with the repeats. Many human cancer mutations map to the region around these motifs, and may be involved in disrupting their binding of beta-catenin.; Armadillo: This entry represents proteins that contain the Armadillo repeat mainly from eukaryotes. These proteins include: Vacuolar protein 8, Importins, Catenins, Junction plakoglobin and related proteins. The armadillo (Arm) repeat is an approximately 40 amino acid long tandemly repeated sequence motif first identified in the Drosophila melanogaster segment polarity gene armadillo involved in signal transduction through wingless. Animal Arm-repeat proteins function in various processes, including intracellular signalling and cytoskeletal regulation, and include such proteins as beta-catenin, the junctional plaque protein plakoglobin, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor protein, and the nuclear transport factor importin-alpha, amongst others. A subset of these proteins is conserved across eukaryotic kingdoms. In higher plants, some Arm-repeat proteins function in intracellular signalling like their mammalian counterparts, while others have novel functions. The 3-dimensional fold of an armadillo repeat is known from the crystal structure of beta-catenin, where the 12 repeats form a superhelix of α helices with three helices per unit. The cylindrical structure features a positively charged grove, which presumably interacts with the acidic surfaces of the known interaction partners of beta-catenin.; Armadillo-like helical: This superfamily represents a domain consisting of a multi-helical fold comprising two curved layers of α-helices arranged in a regular right-handed superhelix, where the repeats that make up this structure are arranged about a common axis. These superhelical structures present an extensive solvent-accessible surface that is well suited to binding large substrates such as proteins and nucleic acids. This topology has been found with a number of repeats and domains, including the armadillo repeat (found in beta-catenins and importins), the HEAT repeat (found in protein phosphatase 2a and initiation factor eIF4G), the PHAT domain (found in Smaug RNA-binding protein), the leucine-rich repeat variant, the Pumilo repeat, and in the H regulatory subunit of V-type ATPases. The sequence similarity among these different repeats or domains is low, however they exhibit considerable structural similarity. Furthermore, the number of repeats present in the superhelical structure can vary between orthologues, indicating that rapid loss/gain of repeats has occurred frequently in evolution. A common phylogenetic origin has been proposed for the armadillo and HEAT repeats.; Armadillo-type fold: This entry represents a structural domain with an armadillo (ARM)-like fold, consisting of a multi-helical fold comprised of two curved layers of α-helices arranged in a regular right-handed superhelix, where the repeats that make up this structure are arranged about a common axis.

A common phylogenetic origin has been proposed for the armadillo and HEAT repeats.; EB-1 binding: This region at the C terminus of the APC proteins binds the microtubule-associating protein EB-1. At the C terminus of the alignment is also a PDZ-binding domain. A short motif in the middle of the region appears to be found in the APC2 proteins (e.g. ).; SAMP: This short region is found repeated in the mid region of the adenomatous polyposis proteins (APCs). This motif binds axin.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in RASA1; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome; C2 domain: The C2 domain is a Ca 2+ -dependent membrane-targeting module found in many cellular proteins involved in signal transduction or membrane trafficking. C2 domains are unique among membrane targeting domains in that they show wide range of lipid selectivity for the major components of cell membranes, including phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine. This C2 domain is about 116 amino-acid residues and is located between the two copies of the C1 domain in Protein Kinase C and the protein kinase catalytic domain. Regions with significant homology to the C2-domain have been found in many proteins. The C2 domain is thought to be involved in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding and in membrane targetting processes such as subcellular localisation. The 3D structure of the C2 domain of synaptotagmin has been reported, the domain forms an eight-stranded β-sandwich constructed around a conserved 4-stranded motif, designated a C2 key. Calcium binds in a cup-shaped depression formed by the N- and C-terminal loops of the C2-key motif. Structural analyses of several C2 domains have shown them to consist of similar ternary structures in which three Ca 2+ -binding loops are located at the end of an 8 stranded antiparallel β-sandwich.; PH-like domain superfamily: This superfamily represents the PH domain and structurally related domains. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are small modular domains that occur in a large variety of signalling proteins, where they serve as simple targeting domains that bind lipids. PH domains have a partly opened β-barrel topology that is capped by an α-helix. The structure of PH domains is similar to the phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) found in IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), Shc adaptor and Numb; to the Ran-binding domain, found in Nup nuclear pore complex and Ranbp1; to the Enabled/VASP homology domain 1 (EVH1 domain), found in Enabled, VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein), Homer and WASP actin regulatory protein; and to the third domain of FERM, found in moesin, radixin, ezrin, merlin and talin.; Pleckstrin homology domain: Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are small modular domains that occur in a large variety of proteins and they have diverse functions, but in general are involved in targeting proteins to the appropriate cellular location or in the interaction with a binding partner, enabling them to interact with other components of signal transduction pathways. They share little sequence conservation, but all have a common fold, which is electrostatically polarised. The domains can bind phosphatidylinositol within biological membranes and proteins such as the beta/gamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins and protein kinase C. PH domains are distinguished from other PIP-binding domains by their specific high-affinity binding to phosphoinositide phosphates (PIPs) with two vicinal phosphate groups: PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 which results in targeting some PH domain proteins to the plasma membrane. A few display strong specificity in lipid binding. Any specificity is usually determined by loop regions or insertions in the N-terminal of the domain, which are not conserved across all PH domains. PH domains have been found to possess inserted domains (such as in PLC gamma, syntrophins) and to be inserted within other domains. Mutations in Brutons tyrosine kinase (Btk) within its PH domain cause X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA) in patients. Point mutations cluster into the positively charged end of the molecule around the predicted binding site for phosphatidylinositol lipids. The 3D structure of several PH domains has been determined. All known cases have a common structure consisting of two perpendicular anti-parallel β-sheets, followed by a C-terminal amphipathic helix. The loops connecting the β-strands differ greatly in length, making the PH domain relatively difficult to detect. There are no totally invariant residues within the PH domain. Proteins reported to contain one more PH domains belong to the following families:; Ras GTPase-activating domain: This entry represents a conserved domain in the RasGAPs (Ras GTPase-activating proteins). This domain is also known as the RasGAP domain. Ras proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that bind GTP and GDP and slowly hydrolyze GTP to GDP. This intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras is regulated by a family of proteins collectively known as 'GAP' or GTPase-activating proteins. RasGAP proteins are usually quite large (from 765 residues for sar1 to 3079 residues for IRA2) but share only a limited (about 250 residues) region of sequence similarity, referred to as the 'catalytic domain' or RasGAP domain. The most conserved region within this domain contains a 15 residue motif which seems to be characteristic of this family of proteins.; Ras GTPase-activating protein: Ras proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that bind GTP and GDP and slowly hydrolyze GTP to GDP. This intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras is regulated by a family of proteins collectively known as 'GAP' or GTPase-activating proteins. RasGAP proteins are usually quite large (from 765 residues for sar1 to 3079 residues for IRA2) but share only a limited (about 250 residues) region of sequence similarity, referred to as the 'catalytic domain' or RasGAP domain. The most conserved region within this domain contains a 15 residue motif which seems to be characteristic of this family of proteins.; Ras GTPase-activating protein 1, C-terminal SH2 domain: Ras GTPase-activating protein 1 (also known as p120-RasGAP) is an inhibitory regulator of the Ras-cyclic AMP pathway. Its C-terminal catalytic domain promotes GTP hydrolysis and plays a key role in the regulation of Ras-GTP bound. Its N-terminal part contains two SH2, SH3, PH (pleckstrin homology) and CaLB/C2 (calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding domain) domains, which allow various functions such as anti-/pro-apoptosis, proliferation and cell migration. Alternative splicing results in two isoforms. The shorter isoform which lacks the N-terminal hydrophobic region, has the same activity, and is expressed in placental tissues. In general the longer isoform contains two SH2 domains, an SH3 domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding C2 domain. The C terminus contains the catalytic domain of RasGap which catalyzes the activation of Ras by hydrolyzing GTP-bound active Ras into an inactive GDP-bound form of Ras. This entry represents the C-terminal SH2 domain.; Ras GTPase-activating protein, conserved site: This entry represents a conserved site in the RasGAPs (Ras GTPase-activating proteins).; RasGAP, SH3 domain: Ras GTPase-activating protein 1 (also known as p120-RasGAP) is an inhibitory regulator of the Ras-cyclic AMP pathway. Its C-terminal catalytic domain promotes GTP hydrolysis and plays a key role in the regulation of Ras-GTP bound. Its N-terminal part contains two SH2, SH3, PH (pleckstrin homology) and CaLB/C2 (calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding domain) domains, which allow various functions such as anti-/pro-apoptosis, proliferation and cell migration. Alternative splicing results in two isoforms. The shorter isoform which lacks the N-terminal hydrophobic region, has the same activity, and is expressed in placental tissues. In general the longer isoform contains two SH2 domains, an SH3 domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding C2 domain. The C terminus contains the catalytic domain of RasGap which catalyzes the activation of Ras by hydrolyzing GTP-bound active Ras into an inactive GDP-bound form of Ras. This entry represents the SH3 domain of RasGAP. The SH3 domain of RasGAP is unable to bind proline-rich sequences but have been shown to interact with protein partners such as the G3BP protein, Aurora kinases, and the Calpain small subunit 1. The RasGAP SH3 domain is necessary for the downstream signaling of Ras and it also influences Rho-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization.; Rho GTPase activation protein: Proteins containing a RhoGAP (Rho GTPase Activating Protein) domain usually function to catalyse the hydrolysis of GTP that is bound to Rho, Rac and/or Cdc42, inactivating these regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. The 53 known human RhoGAP domain-containing proteins are the largest known group of Rho GTPase regulators and significantly outnumber the 21 Rho GTPases they presumably regulate. This excess of GAP proteins probably indicates complex regulation of the Rho GTPases and is consistent with the existence of almost as many (48) human Dbl domain-containing Rho GEFs that act antagonistically to the RhoGAP proteins by activating the Rho GTPases. Phylogenetic analysis offers evidence for frequent domain duplication and for duplication of the entire genes containing these GAP domains.; SH2 domain: The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain is a protein domain of about 100 amino-acid residues first identified as a conserved sequence region between the oncoproteins Src and Fps. Similar sequences were later found in many other intracellular signal-transducing proteins. SH2 domains function as regulatory modules of intracellular signalling cascades by interacting with high affinity to phosphotyrosine-containing target peptides in a sequence-specific, SH2 domains recognise between 3-6 residues C-terminal to the phosphorylated tyrosine in a fashion that differs from one SH2 domain to another, and strictly phosphorylation-dependent manner. They are found in a wide variety of protein contexts e.g., in association with catalytic domains of phospholipase Cy (PLCy) and the non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases; within structural proteins such as fodrin and tensin; and in a group of small adaptor molecules, i.e Crk and Nck. The domains are frequently found as repeats in a single protein sequence and will then often bind both mono- and di-phosphorylated substrates. The structure of the SH2 domain belongs to the α+β class, its overall shape forming a compact flattened hemisphere. The core structural elements comprise a central hydrophobic anti-parallel β-sheet, flanked by 2 short α-helices. The loop between strands 2 and 3 provides many of the binding interactions with the phosphate group of its phosphopeptide ligand, and is hence designated the phosphate binding loop, the phosphorylated ligand binds perpendicular to the β-sheet and typically interacts with the phosphate binding loop and a hydrophobic binding pocket that interacts with a pY+3 side chain. The N- and C-termini of the domain are close together in space and on the opposite face from the phosphopeptide binding surface and it has been speculated that this has facilitated their integration into surface-exposed regions of host proteins.; SH3 domain: SH3 (src Homology-3) domains are small protein modules containing approximately 50 amino acid residues. They are found in a great variety of intracellular or membrane-associated proteins for example, in a variety of proteins with enzymatic activity, in adaptor proteins, such as fodrin and yeast actin binding protein ABP-1. The SH3 domain has a characteristic fold which consists of five or six β-strands arranged as two tightly packed anti-parallel β-sheets. The linker regions may contain short helices. The surface of the SH3-domain bears a flat, hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket which consists of three shallow grooves defined by conservative aromatic residues in which the ligand adopts an extended left-handed helical arrangement. The ligand binds with low affinity but this may be enhanced by multiple interactions. The region bound by the SH3 domain is in all cases proline-rich and contains PXXP as a core-conserved binding motif. The function of the SH3 domain is not well understood but they may mediate many diverse processes such as increasing local concentration of proteins, altering their subcellular location and mediating the assembly of large multiprotein complexes. The crystal structure of the SH3 domain of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin, and the solution structures of SH3 domains of phospholipase C (PLC-y) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 alpha-subunit, have been determined. In spite of relatively limited sequence similarity, their overall structures are similar. The domains belong to the α+β structural class, with five to eight β-strands forming 2 tightly-packed, anti-parallel β-sheets arranged in a barrel-like structure, and intervening loops sometimes forming helices. Conserved aliphatic and aromatic residues form a hydrophobic core (A11, L23, A29, V34, W42, L52 and V59 in PLC-y) and a hydrophobic pocket on the molecular surface (L12, F13, W53 and P55 in PLC-y). The conserved core is believed to stabilise the fold, while the pocket is thought to serve as a binding site for target proteins. Conserved carboxylic amino acids located in the loops, on the periphery of the pocket (D14 and E22), may be involved in protein-protein interactions via proline-rich regions. The N- and C-terminal are packed in close proximity, indicating that they are independent structural modules.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in BLM; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Bloom syndrome; ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecQ, zinc-binding domain: This domain is the zinc-binding domain of ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecQ.; BDHCT: This is a C-terminal domain in RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM subfamily. The helicase participates in DNA replication and repair, exhibiting a magnesium-dependent ATP-dependent DNA-helicase activity that unwinds single- and double-stranded DNA in a 3'-5' direction.; DEAD/DEAH-box helicase domain: This entry represents the DNA-binding domain at the N-terminal in DEAD/DEAH box helicase and related proteins. This domain also contains motif III (S-A-T) which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities. DEAD-box and DEAH-box RNA helicases are essential enzymes involved in the unwinding of nucleic acids, playing critical roles in RNA metabolism. The DEAD-box helicases, exemplified by the translation initiation factor eIF4A, are RNA-dependent ATPases that act as RNA helicases in conjunction with eIF4B. These proteins participate in a wide range of processes including nuclear transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, nucleocytoplasmic transport, translation, RNA decay and organellar gene expression. In contrast, DEAH-box helicases are primarily involved in pre-mRNA splicing and function as ATP-dependent RNA helicases.; DNA helicase, ATP-dependent, RecQ type: The ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecQ is involved in genome maintenance. All homologues tested to date unwind paired DNA, translocating in a 3' to 5' direction and several have a preference for forked or 4-way DNA structures (e.g. Holliday junctions) or for G-quartet DNA. The yeast protein, Sgs1, is present in numerous foci that coincide with sites of de novo synthesis DNA, such as the replication fork, and protein levels peak during S-phase. A model has been proposed for Sgs1p action in the S-phase checkpoint response, both as a 'sensor' for damage during replication and a 'resolvase' for structures that arise at paused forks, such as the four-way 'chickenfoot' structure. The action of Sgs1p may serve to maintain the proper amount and integrity of ss DNA that is necessary for the binding of RPA (replication protein A, the eukaryotic ss DNA-binding protein)-DNA pol complexes. Sgs1p would thus function by detecting (or resolving) aberrant DNA structures, and would thus contribute to the full activation of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, Mec1p and the effector kinase, Rad53p. Its ability to bind both the large subunit of RPA and the RecA-like protein Rad51p, place it in a unique position to resolve inappropriate fork structures that can occur when either the leading or lagging strand synthesis is stalled. Thus, RecQ helicases integrate checkpoint activation and checkpoint response.; DNA/RNA helicase, ATP-dependent, DEAH-box type, conserved site: A number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins have been characterised on the basis of their structural similarity. They all seem to be involved in ATP-dependent, nucleic-acid unwinding. There are two subfamilies of such proteins, the D-E-A-D-box and D-E-A-H-box families. Proteins that belong to the subfamily which have His instead of the second Asp are said to be 'D-E-A-H-box' proteins. Proteins currently known to belong to this subfamily include yeast PRP2, PRP16, PRP22 and PRP43, involved in various ATP-requiring steps of the pre-mRNA splicing process; fission yeast prh1, which my be involved in pre-mRNA splicing; Drosophila male-less (mle) protein required in males for dosage compensation of X chromosome linked genes; yeast RAD3, a DNA helicase involved in excision repair of DNA damaged by UV light, bulky adducts or cross-linking agents; fission yeast rad15 (rhp3) and mammalian DNA excision repair protein XPD (ERCC-2); yeast CHL1 (or CTF1), which is important for chromosome transmission and normal cell cycle progression in G(2)/M; yeast TPS1, Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins C06E1.10 and K03H1.2; Poxviruses' early transcription factor 70kDa subunit which acts with RNA polymerase to initiate transcription from early gene promoters; Vaccinia virus putative helicase I8; and Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase hrpA. All these proteins share a number of conserved sequence motifs. Some of them are specific to this family while others are shared by other ATP-binding proteins or by proteins belonging to the helicases 'superfamily'.; Helicase superfamily 1/2, ATP-binding domain: This entry represents the DNA-binding domain of classical SF1 and SF2 helicases. It does not recognise bacterial DinG and eukaryotic Rad3 which differ from other SF1-SF2 helicases by the presence of a large insert after the Walker A (see ). Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). All of the proteins bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A (phosphate-binding loop or P-loop) and Walker B (Mg2+-binding aspartic acid) motifs. For the two largest groups, commonly referred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been identified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses that seem to be active as monomers or dimers. RNA and DNA helicases are considered to be enzymes that catalyse the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in an energy-dependent manner. The various structures of SF1 and SF2 helicases present a common core with two α-β RecA-like domains. The structural homology with the RecA recombination protein covers the five contiguous parallel β-strands and the tandem α-helices. ATP binds to the amino proximal α-β domain, where the Walker A (motif I) and Walker B (motif II) are found. The N-terminal domain also contains motif III (S-A-T) which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities. The carboxy-terminal α-β domain is structurally very similar to the proximal one even though it is bereft of an ATP-binding site, suggesting that it may have originally arisen through gene duplication of the first one. Some members of helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 are listed below:; Helicase, C-terminal domain-like: Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). For the two largest groups, commonly referred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been identified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses. This entry represents the C-terminal domain found in proteins belonging to the helicase superfamilies 1 and 2. Included in this group is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), a member of the DEA(D/H)-box RNA helicase family. The structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of eIF4A has been determined; it has a parallel α-β topology that superimposes, with minor variations, on the structures and conserved motifs of the equivalent domain in other, distantly related helicases.; HRDC domain: The HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain is comprised of two orthogonally packed α-hairpin subdomains, and is involved in interactions with DNA and protein. It has been suggested that this domain plays a role dissolving double Holliday junctions efficiently. HRDC domains are found at the C terminus of many RecQ helicases, including the human Bifunctional 3'-5' exonuclease/ATP-dependent helicase WRN and RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM. RecQ helicases have been shown to unwind DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. The structure of the HRDC domain consists of a 4-5 helical bundle of two orthogonally packed α-hairpins, and as such it resembles auxiliary domains in bacterial DNA helicases and other proteins that interact with nucleic acids. A positively charged region on the surface of the HRDC domain is able to interact with DNA. The HRDC domain is also present in eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerase II subunit RBP4, the N-terminal of which forms a heterodimerisation α-hairpin. The HRDC domain has a putative role in nucleic acid binding. Mutations in the HRDC domain associated with the human BLM gene result in Bloom Syndrome (BS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by proportionate pre- and postnatal growth deficiency; sun-sensitive, telangiectatic, hypo- and hyperpigmented skin; predisposition to malignancy; and chromosomal instability.; HRDC-like superfamily: This superfamily represents the HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain, which comprises two orthogonally packed α-hairpin subdomains, and is involved in interactions with DNA and protein. The HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain is found at the C terminus of many RecQ helicases, including the human Bifunctional 3'-5' exonuclease/ATP-dependent helicase WRN and RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM (previously known as Werner and Bloom syndrome proteins). RecQ helicases have been shown to unwind DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. The structure of the HRDC domain consists of a 4-5 helical bundle of two orthogonally packed α-hairpins, and as such it resembles auxiliary domains in bacterial DNA helicases and other proteins that interact with nucleic acids. A positively charged region on the surface of the HRDC domain is able to interact with DNA. The HRDC domain is also present in eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerase II subunit RBP4, the N-terminal of which forms a heterodimerisation α-hairpin.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.; RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM, BDHCT-box associated domain: This domain is found on RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM in higher eukaryotes. It lies between the BDHCT, and DEAD-box domains. This domain, together with, may play a role in regulation and oligomerization of BLM. These domains are also important in mediating interactions with partner proteins.; RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM, N-terminal domain: This is the very N-terminal region of chordate RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM proteins. BLM participates in DNA replication and repair. This domain, together with, may play a role in regulation and oligomerization of BLM. These domains are also important in mediating interactions with partner proteins.; RQC domain: This entry represents the RQC domain, which is a DNA-binding domain found only in RecQ family enzymes. RecQ family helicases can unwind G4 DNA, and play important roles at G-rich domains of the genome, including the telomeres, rDNA, and immunoglobulin switch regions. This domain has a helix-turn-helix structure and acts as a high affinity G4 DNA binding domain. Binding of RecQ to Holliday junctions involves both the RQC and the HRDC domains.; Winged helix DNA-binding domain superfamily: Winged helix DNA-binding proteins share a related winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, where the \"wings\", or loops, are small β-sheets. The winged helix motif consists of two wings (W1, W2), three α-helices (H1, H2, H3) and three β-sheets (S1, S2, S3) arranged in the order H1-S1-H2-H3-S2-W1-S3-W2. The DNA-recognition helix makes sequence-specific DNA contacts with the major groove of DNA, while the wings make different DNA contacts, often with the minor groove or the backbone of DNA. Several winged-helix proteins display an exposed patch of hydrophobic residues thought to mediate protein-protein interactions.; Winged helix-like DNA-binding domain superfamily: Winged helix DNA-binding proteins share a related winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, where the \"wings\", or loops, are small β-sheets. The winged helix motif consists of two wings (W1, W2), three α-helices (H1, H2, H3) and three β-sheets (S1, S2, S3) arranged in the order H1-S1-H2-H3-S2-W1-S3-W2. The DNA-recognition helix makes sequence-specific DNA contacts with the major groove of DNA, while the wings make different DNA contacts, often with the minor groove or the backbone of DNA. Several winged-helix proteins display an exposed patch of hydrophobic residues thought to mediate protein-protein interactions. Many different proteins with diverse biological functions contain a winged helix DNA-binding domain, including transcriptional repressors such as biotin repressor, LexA repressor and the arginine repressor; transcription factors such as the hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 proteins involved in cell differentiation, heat-shock transcription factor, and the general transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIF; helicases such as RuvB that promotes branch migration at the Holliday junction, and CDC6 in the pre-replication complex; endonucleases such as FokI and TnsA; histones; and Mu transposase, where the flexible wing of the enhancer-binding domain is essential for efficient transposition.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in RB1; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Retinoblastoma; Cyclin-like domain: This cyclin-like domain is found in cyclins, but it is also found as the core domain in transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and in the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor. It consists of a duplication of a fold consisting of 5 helices, one of them surrounded by the others.; Cyclin-like superfamily: This cyclin-like domain superfamily is found in cyclins, but it is also found as the core domain in transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and in the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor. It consists of a duplication of a fold consisting of 5 helices, one of them surrounded by the others.; Retinoblastoma protein family: This entry represents the retinoblastoma protein family, including retinoblastoma-associated protein (RB, also known as pRb, RB, p1051), retinoblastoma-like protein 1 (RBL1, also known as p107) and retinoblastoma-like protein 2 (RBL2, also known as RB2 or p130). Members of this family contain a conserved domain named the 'pocket' that interacts with the LXCXE motif found in viral proteins, such as SV40 large T antigen. Therefore, this family is also called the pocket protein family. In humans, RB is a tumour suppressor linked to several major cancers. RB forms complexes with E2Fs and represses gene expression by recruiting chromatin remodeling factors, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) to E2F-responsive promoters. This interaction regulates genes necessary for DNA replication and cell cycle. Phosphorylation of RB family by CDK and cyclin complexes leads to release of the repressor complex and enables E2F-dependent gene expression. Apart from E2Fs, RB also interacts with other transcription factors that govern cell differentiation.; Retinoblastoma-associated protein, A-box; Retinoblastoma-associated protein, B-box: This entry includes retinoblastoma-associated protein (RB, also known as pRb, RB, p1051), retinoblastoma-like protein 1 (RBL1, also known as p107) and retinoblastoma-like protein 2 (RBL2, also known as RB2 or p130). Members of this entry contain a conserved domain named the 'pocket' that interacts with the LXCXE motif found in viral proteins, such as SV40 large T antigen. This pocket consists of A- and B-boxes which are found at the C-terminal end of the protein. This entry represents the B-box, that is on C-terminal side of the A-box. The crystal structure of the RB pocket bound to a nine-residue E7 peptide containing the LxCxE motif, shared by other RB-binding viral and cellular proteins, shows that the LxCxE peptide binds a highly conserved groove on the B-box portion of the pocket; the A-box portion (see ) appears to be required for the stable folding of the B box. Also highly conserved is the extensive A-B interface, suggesting that it may be an additional protein-binding site. The A and B boxes each contain the cyclin-fold structural motif, with the LxCxE-binding site on the B-box cyclin fold being similar to a Cdk2-binding site of cyclin A and to a TBP-binding site of TFIIB. In humans, RB is a tumour suppressor linked to several major cancers. RB forms complexes with E2Fs and represses gene expression by recruiting chromatin remodeling factors, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) to E2F-responsive promoters. Apart from E2Fs, RB also interacts with other transcription factors that govern cell differentiation. RBL1 and RBL2 are the components of the DREAM complex, which represses cell cycle-dependent genes in quiescent cells and plays a role in the cell cycle-dependent activation of G2/M genes.; Retinoblastoma-associated protein, C-terminal: The RB C-terminal domain is required for high-affinity binding to E2F-DP complexes and for maximal repression of E2F-responsive promoters, thereby acting as a growth suppressor by blocking the G1-S transition of the cell cycle. This domain has a strand-loop-helix structure, which directly interacts with both E2F1 and DP1, followed by a tail segment that lacks regular secondary structure.; Retinoblastoma-associated protein, N-terminal: This domain is found in N-terminal of the retinoblastoma-associated protein. It is found in association with and. This domain is typically between 124 to 150 amino acids in length and has a single completely conserved residue W that may be functionally important.",

The rhodopsin-like GPCRs (GPCRA) represent a widespread protein family that includes hormone, neurotransmitter and light receptors, all of which transduce extracellular signals through interaction with guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins. Although their activating ligands vary widely in structure and character, the amino acid sequences of the receptors are very similar and are believed to adopt a common structural framework comprising 7 transmembrane (TM) helices. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a vast protein family that encompasses a wide range of functions, including various autocrine, paracrine and endocrine processes. They show considerable diversity at the sequence level, on the basis of which they can be separated into distinct groups. The term clan can be used to describe the GPCRs, as they embrace a group of families for which there are indications of evolutionary relationship, but between which there is no statistically significant similarity in sequence. The currently known clan members include rhodopsin-like GPCRs (Class A, GPCRA), secretin-like GPCRs (Class B, GPCRB), metabotropic glutamate receptor family (Class C, GPCRC), fungal mating pheromone receptors (Class D, GPCRD), cAMP receptors (Class E, GPCRE) and frizzled/smoothened (Class F, GPCRF). GPCRs are major drug targets, and are consequently the subject of considerable research interest. It has been reported that the repertoire of GPCRs for endogenous ligands consists of approximately 400 receptors in humans and mice. Most GPCRs are identified on the basis of their DNA sequences, rather than the ligand they bind, those that are unmatched to known natural ligands are designated by as orphan GPCRs, or unclassified GPCRs.; Glycoprotein hormone receptor family: Glycoprotein hormones (or gonadotropins) are protein hormones, that includes the mammalian hormones follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH, also known as follitropin), luteinizing hormone (LH, also known as lutropin), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, also known as thyrotropin) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). These hormones are central to the complex endocrine system that regulates normal growth, sexual development, and reproductive function. The hormones FSH, LH and TSH are secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, while the choriogonadotropins are secreted by the placenta. Glycoprotein hormone receptors are members the rhodopsin-like G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family. They function as receptors for the pituitary hormones thyrotropin (TSH receptor), follitropin (FSH receptor) and lutropin (LH receptor). In mammals the LH receptor is also the receptor for the placental hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), so is denominated as a lutropin-choriogonadotropic hormone receptor (LHCG receptor). The receptors share close sequence similarity, and are characterised by large extracellular domains believed to be involved in hormone binding via leucine-rich repeats (LRR). This entry represents the glycoprotein hormone receptor family, which includes the follicle stimulating hormone receptor, lutropin-choriogonadotropic hormone receptor and the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor.; GPCR, rhodopsin-like, 7TM: This entry spans the seven transmembrane regions of rhodopsin-like GPCRs. It also identifies some non rhodopsin-like GPCRs, including a number of taste receptors and vomeronasal receptors.

Hrp3 is involved in heterochromatin silencing. It is predicted to adopt an HTH structure and is often found C-terminal to.; CDH1/2, SANT-Helical linker 1: CDH1 is an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling factor and plays an important role in regulating nucleosome assembly and mobilization. CHD1 consists of double chromodomain, SNF2-related ATPase domain, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The DNA-binding domain contains SANT (Swi3, Ada2, N-CoR, TFIIIB) and SLIDE (SANT-like ISWI) domains in its C-terminal region. SANT domains are structurally related to Myb-like domains are common motifs found in chromatin interacting proteins. Deletion of individual SANT or SLIDE domains in CDH1 does not significantly affect nucleosome binding, but combined deletion of both domains severely compromise binding, suggesting that the SANT-SLIDE motif recognizes DNA/nucleosomes as a single cooperative unit. SANT sequences of Chd1 proteins are the most distantly relation group of sequences relation to other SANT/Myb sequences, and are more diverse than other SANT proteins. The SANT and SLIDE regions are well conserved in both Chd1 and ISWI (imitation switch) remodelling enzymes. This domain comprises the SANT region and the helical linker region 1 (HL1).; Chromo domain: The CHROMO (CHRromatin Organization MOdifier) domain is a conserved region of around 60 amino acids, originally identified in Drosophila modifiers of variegation. These are proteins that alter the structure of chromatin to the condensed morphology of heterochromatin, a cytologically visible condition where gene expression is repressed. In one of these proteins, Polycomb, the chromo domain has been shown to be important for chromatin targeting. Proteins that contain a chromo domain appear to fall into 3 classes. The first class includes proteins having an N-terminal chromo domain followed by a region termed the chromo shadow domain, with weak but significant sequence similarity to the N-terminal chromo domain, eg. Drosophila and human heterochromatin protein Su(var)205 (HP1). The second class includes proteins with a single chromo domain, eg. Drosophila protein Polycomb (Pc); mammalian modifier 3; human Mi-2 autoantigen and several yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins. In the third class paired tandem chromo domains are found, eg. in mammalian DNA-binding/helicase proteins CHD-1 to CHD-4 and yeast protein CHD1. Functional dissections of chromo domain proteins suggests a mechanistic role for chromo domains in targeting chromo domain proteins to specific regions of the nucleus. The mechanism of targeting may involve protein-protein and/or protein/nucleic acid interactions. Hence, several line of evidence show that the HP1 chromo domain is a methyl-specific histone binding module, whereas the chromo domain of two protein components of the drosophila dosage compensation complex, MSL3 and MOF, contain chromo domains that bind to RNA in vitro. The high resolution structures of HP1-family protein chromo and chromo shadow domain reveal a conserved chromo domain fold motif consisting of three β-strands packed against an α-helix. The chromo domain fold belongs to the OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding)-fold class found in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleic acid binding protein.; Chromo domain, conserved site: The CHROMO (CHRromatin Organization MOdifier) domain is a conserved region of around 60 amino acids, originally identified in Drosophila modifiers of variegation.

The chromo domain fold belongs to the OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding)-fold class found in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleic acid binding protein. This entry represents a conserved site in the chromo domain.; Chromo-like domain superfamily: This entry represents a chromo (CHRromatin Organization MOdifier) structural domain, which consists of an SH3-like β-barrel capped by a C-terminal helix. Chromo domains are conserved modules of around 60 amino acids that are implicated in the recognition of lysine-methylated histone tails and nucleic acids. Chromo domains were originally identified in Drosophila modifiers of variegation, proteins that alter the structure of chromatin to the condensed morphology of heterochromatin. Domains with a chromo domain structural fold include: Chromo domains can be found in various nuclear proteins, including heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) (N-terminal chromo domain and C-terminal chromo shadow domain), where the chromo domain recognises histone tails with specifically methylated lysines; polycomb protein Pc, which is essential for maintaining the silencing state of homeotic genes during development (chromo domain important for chromatin targeting); histone methyltransferase clr4, which regulates silencing and switching at the mating-type loci and to affect chromatin structure at centromeres; and the ATP-dependent helicase CHD1, which regulates ATP-dependent nucleosome assembly and mobilisation through conserved double chromo domains and a SWI2/SNF2 helicase/ATPase domain. Chromo barrel domains are found in various histone acetyltransferases, such as MYST1 from Mus musculus (Mouse) and MOF from Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly). This domain can also be found in the human mortality factor 4-like protein, MRG15.; Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 1-like, C-terminal domain: This entry represents a domain found at the C terminus of chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding proteins, including Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 1 from human (CHD1), an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factor which acts as substrate recognition component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA. This protein functions to modulate the efficiency of pre-mRNA splicing in part through physical bridging of spliceosomal components to H3K4me3. This helical domain, which is also found in CHD1 helical C-terminal domain-containing protein 1 (also known as C17orf64) from mammals, consists of five α-helices organised in a variant helical bundle topology. Its surface is positively charged and can bind dsDNA and nucleosomes, but its specific function remains unknown.; Helicase superfamily 1/2, ATP-binding domain: This entry represents the DNA-binding domain of classical SF1 and SF2 helicases. It does not recognise bacterial DinG and eukaryotic Rad3 which differ from other SF1-SF2 helicases by the presence of a large insert after the Walker A (see ). Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). All of the proteins bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A (phosphate-binding loop or P-loop) and Walker B (Mg2+-binding aspartic acid) motifs. For the two largest groups, commonly referred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been identified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses that seem to be active as monomers or dimers. RNA and DNA helicases are considered to be enzymes that catalyse the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in an energy-dependent manner. The various structures of SF1 and SF2 helicases present a common core with two α-β RecA-like domains. The structural homology with the RecA recombination protein covers the five contiguous parallel β-strands and the tandem α-helices. ATP binds to the amino proximal α-β domain, where the Walker A (motif I) and Walker B (motif II) are found. The N-terminal domain also contains motif III (S-A-T) which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities. The carboxy-terminal α-β domain is structurally very similar to the proximal one even though it is bereft of an ATP-binding site, suggesting that it may have originally arisen through gene duplication of the first one. Some members of helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 are listed below:; Helicase, C-terminal domain-like: Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). For the two largest groups, commonly referred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been identified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses. This entry represents the C-terminal domain found in proteins belonging to the helicase superfamilies 1 and 2. Included in this group is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), a member of the DEA(D/H)-box RNA helicase family. The structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of eIF4A has been determined; it has a parallel α-β topology that superimposes, with minor variations, on the structures and conserved motifs of the equivalent domain in other, distantly related helicases.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.; SNF2, N-terminal: This domain is found in proteins involved in a variety of processes including transcription regulation (e.g., SNF2, STH1, brahma, MOT1), DNA repair (e.g., ERCC6, RAD16, RAD5), DNA recombination (e.g., RAD54), and chromatin unwinding (e.g., ISWI) as well as a variety of other proteins with little functional information (e.g., lodestar, ETL1). SNF2 functions as the ATPase component of the SNF2/SWI multisubunit complex, which utilises energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt histone-DNA interactions, resulting in the increased accessibility of DNA to transcription factors.; SNF2-like, N-terminal domain superfamily: This domain is found in proteins involved in a variety of processes including transcription regulation (e.g., SNF2, STH1, MOT1), DNA repair (e.g., RAD16, RAD5), DNA recombination (e.g., RAD54), and chromatin unwinding (e.g., ISWI) as well as a variety of other proteins with little functional information. SNF2 functions as the ATPase component of the SNF2/SWI multisubunit complex, which utilises energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt histone-DNA interactions, resulting in the increased accessibility of DNA to transcription factors. Proteins that contain this domain appear to be distantly related to the DEAX box helicases.; SNF2/RAD5-like, C-terminal helicase domain: This entry represents the C-terminal helicase domain of yeast DNA repair and recombination protein RAD54 and similar sequences from all domains in life. The Sucrose Non-Fermenting (SNF) family includes chromatin-remodeling factors, such as CHD proteins and SMARCA proteins, recombination proteins Rad54, and many others. They are DEAD-like helicases belonging to superfamily (SF)2, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. Similar to SF1 helicases, SF2 helicases do not form toroidal structures like SF3-6 helicases. Their helicase core consists of two similar protein domains that resemble the fold of the recombination protein RecA.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in ABCB11; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; AAA+ ATPase domain: This entry represents the AAA+ ATPase domain found in a range of proteins, including Holliday junction ATP-dependent DNA helicase RuvB from Mycobacterium sp, ATP synthases, and related ATP-dependent proteins. The proteins in this superfamily are characterised by the structural conservation of a central ATPase domain of about 250 amino acids called the AAA module. Typically, the AAA domain can be divided into two structural subdomains, an N-terminal P-loop NTPase α-β-α subdomain that is connected to a smaller C-terminal all-α subdomain. The α-β-α subdomain adopts a Rossman fold and contains several motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, including classical motifs Walker A and Walker B. The all-α subdomain, is much less conserved across AAA proteins. The AAA+ superfamily of ATPases is found in all kingdoms of living organisms where they participate in diverse cellular processes including membrane fusion, proteolysis and DNA replication. Although the terms AAA+ and AAA are often used loosely and interchangeably, the classical AAA family members are distinguished by their possession of the SRH region in the AAA module. Many AAA+ proteins are involved in similar processes to those of AAA proteins (facilitation of protein folding and unfolding, assembly or disassembly of proteins complexes, protein transport and degradation), but others function in replication, recombination, repair and transcription. For a review see.; ABC transporter type 1, transmembrane domain: This entry represents the transmembrane domain in cases where the TMD and ABC region are found in the same protein, and corresponds to ABC type 1 from Transporter Classification Database. ABC transporters minimally contain two conserved regions: a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). In certain bacterial transporters, these regions are found on different polypeptides. The function of the integral inner-membrane protein is to translocate the substrate across the membrane, as well as in substrate recognition. ABC transporters belong to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily, which uses the hydrolysis of ATP to energise diverse biological systems. ABC transporters minimally consist of two conserved regions: a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). These can be found on the same protein or on two different ones. Most ABC transporters function as a dimer and therefore are constituted of four domains, two ABC modules and two TMDs. ABC transporters are involved in the export or import of a wide variety of substrates ranging from small ions to macromolecules. The major function of ABC import systems is to provide essential nutrients to bacteria. They are found only in prokaryotes and their four constitutive domains are usually encoded by independent polypeptides (two ABC proteins and two TMD proteins). Prokaryotic importers require additional extracytoplasmic binding proteins (one or more per systems) for function. In contrast, export systems are involved in the extrusion of noxious substances, the export of extracellular toxins and the targeting of membrane components. They are found in all living organisms and in general the TMD is fused to the ABC module in a variety of combinations. Some eukaryotic exporters encode the four domains on the same polypeptide chain. The ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily forms one of the largest of all protein families with a diversity of physiological functions. Several studies have shown that there is a correlation between the functional characterisation and the phylogenetic classification of the ABC cassette.

The ABC module (approximately two hundred amino acid residues) is known to bind and hydrolyse ATP, thereby coupling transport to ATP hydrolysis in a large number of biological processes. The cassette is duplicated in several subfamilies. Its primary sequence is highly conserved, displaying a typical phosphate-binding loop: Walker A, and a magnesium binding site: Walker B. Besides these two regions, three other conserved motifs are present in the ABC cassette: the switch region which contains a histidine loop, postulated to polarise the attaching water molecule for hydrolysis, the signature conserved motif (LSGGQ) specific to the ABC transporter, and the Q-motif (between Walker A and the signature), which interacts with the gamma phosphate through a water bond. The Walker A, Walker B, Q-loop and switch region form the nucleotide binding site. The 3D structure of a monomeric ABC module adopts a stubby L-shape with two distinct arms. ArmI (mainly β-strand) contains Walker A and Walker B. The important residues for ATP hydrolysis and/or binding are located in the P-loop. The ATP-binding pocket is located at the extremity of armI. The perpendicular armII contains mostly the α helical subdomain with the signature motif. It only seems to be required for structural integrity of the ABC module. ArmII is in direct contact with the TMD. The hinge between armI and armII contains both the histidine loop and the Q-loop, making contact with the gamma phosphate of the ATP molecule. ATP hydrolysis leads to a conformational change that could facilitate ADP release. In the dimer the two ABC cassettes contact each other through hydrophobic interactions at the antiparallel β-sheet of armI by a two-fold axis. The ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily forms one of the largest of all protein families with a diversity of physiological functions. Several studies have shown that there is a correlation between the functional characterisation and the phylogenetic classification of the ABC cassette. More than 50 subfamilies have been described based on a phylogenetic and functional classification.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.; Type 1 protein exporter: Proteins in this entry are required for type I protein secretion and have an N-terminal ABC transporter type 1 transmembrane domain and a C-terminal P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase domain. The transmembrane domain forms a pore in the inner membrane and the ATP-binding domain is responsible for energy generation. Sequences are mainly from bacteria, but there are homologues from eukaryotes and archaea. Proteins in this entry include the following:",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in ABCB11; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; AAA+ ATPase domain: This entry represents the AAA+ ATPase domain found in a range of proteins, including Holliday junction ATP-dependent DNA helicase RuvB from Mycobacterium sp, ATP synthases, and related ATP-dependent proteins. The proteins in this superfamily are characterised by the structural conservation of a central ATPase domain of about 250 amino acids called the AAA module. Typically, the AAA domain can be divided into two structural subdomains, an N-terminal P-loop NTPase α-β-α subdomain that is connected to a smaller C-terminal all-α subdomain. The α-β-α subdomain adopts a Rossman fold and contains several motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, including classical motifs Walker A and Walker B. The all-α subdomain, is much less conserved across AAA proteins. The AAA+ superfamily of ATPases is found in all kingdoms of living organisms where they participate in diverse cellular processes including membrane fusion, proteolysis and DNA replication. Although the terms AAA+ and AAA are often used loosely and interchangeably, the classical AAA family members are distinguished by their possession of the SRH region in the AAA module. Many AAA+ proteins are involved in similar processes to those of AAA proteins (facilitation of protein folding and unfolding, assembly or disassembly of proteins complexes, protein transport and degradation), but others function in replication, recombination, repair and transcription. For a review see.; ABC transporter type 1, transmembrane domain: This entry represents the transmembrane domain in cases where the TMD and ABC region are found in the same protein, and corresponds to ABC type 1 from Transporter Classification Database. ABC transporters minimally contain two conserved regions: a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). In certain bacterial transporters, these regions are found on different polypeptides. The function of the integral inner-membrane protein is to translocate the substrate across the membrane, as well as in substrate recognition. ABC transporters belong to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily, which uses the hydrolysis of ATP to energise diverse biological systems. ABC transporters minimally consist of two conserved regions: a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). These can be found on the same protein or on two different ones. Most ABC transporters function as a dimer and therefore are constituted of four domains, two ABC modules and two TMDs. ABC transporters are involved in the export or import of a wide variety of substrates ranging from small ions to macromolecules. The major function of ABC import systems is to provide essential nutrients to bacteria. They are found only in prokaryotes and their four constitutive domains are usually encoded by independent polypeptides (two ABC proteins and two TMD proteins). Prokaryotic importers require additional extracytoplasmic binding proteins (one or more per systems) for function.

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in USH2A; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Fibronectin type III: Fibronectin is a dimeric glycoprotein composed of disulfide-linked subunits with a molecular weight of 220-250kDa each. It is involved in cell adhesion, cell morphology, thrombosis, cell migration, and embryonic differentiation. Fibronectin is a modular protein composed of homologous repeats of three prototypical types of domains known as types I, II, and III. Fibronectin type-III (FN3) repeats are both the largest and the most common of the fibronectin subdomains. Domains homologous to FN3 repeats have been found in various animal protein families including other extracellular-matrix molecules, cell-surface receptors, enzymes, and muscle proteins. Structures of individual FN3 domains have revealed a conserved β-sandwich fold with one β-sheet containing four strands and the other sheet containing three strands (see for example ). This fold is topologically very similar to that of Ig-like domains, with a notable difference being the lack of a conserved disulfide bond in FN3 domains. Distinctive hydrophobic core packing and the lack of detectable sequence homology between immunoglobulin and FN3 domains suggest, however, that these domains are not evolutionarily related. FN3 exhibits functional as well as structural modularity. Sites of interaction with other molecules have been mapped to short stretch of amino acids such as the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence found in various FN3 domains. The RGD sequences is involved in interactions with integrin. Small peptides containing the RGD sequence can modulate a variety of cell adhesion invents associated with thrombosis, inflammation, and tumour metastasis. These properties have led to the investigation of RGD peptides and RGD peptide analogues as potential therapeutic agents.; Immunoglobulin-like fold: This superfamily represents domains with an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) fold, which consists of a β-sandwich of seven or more strands in two sheets with a Greek-key topology. Ig-like domains are one of the most common protein modules found in animals, occurring in a variety of different proteins. These domains are often involved in interactions, commonly with other Ig-like domains via their β-sheets. Domains within this fold-family share the same structure, but can diverge with respect to their sequence. Based on sequence, Ig-like domains can be classified as V-set domains (antibody variable domain-like), C1-set domains (antibody constant domain-like), C2-set domains, and I-set domains (antibody intermediate domain-like). Proteins can contain more than one of these types of Ig-like domains. For example, in the human T-cell receptor antigen CD2, domain 1 (D1) is a V-set domain, while domain 2 (D2) is a C2-set domain, both domains having the same Ig-like fold. Domains with an Ig-like fold can be found in many, diverse proteins in addition to immunoglobulin molecules. For example, Ig-like domains occur in several different types of receptors (such as various T-cell antigen receptors), several cell adhesion molecules, MHC class I and II antigens, as well as the hemolymph protein hemolin, and the muscle proteins titin, telokin and twitchin.; Receptor-type Tyrosine-protein Phosphatases/Ushers: The protein family includes receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatases and ushers, which are involved in a variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Members of the family play crucial roles in the maintenance and remodeling of blood vessels, as well as in the regulation of cell signaling pathways through their enzymatic activity of dephosphorylation. They are essential for normal brain development, auditory function, and vision, acting in complexes such as the USH2 complex for the maintenance of periciliary membrane complexes and hair bundle ankle formation. Additionally, they contribute to contact inhibition of cell growth, apoptotic cell death, and the suppression of immune responses. The family's phosphatases are involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and may also influence the differentiation of cells in bone and testis.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in SLC26A3; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; SLC26A/SulP transporter: The SLC26A/SulP family is a large and ubiquitous family with members derived from archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. Many organisms including Bacillus subtilis, Synechocystis sp, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana and Caenorhabditis elegans possess multiple SulP family paralogues. Many of these proteins are functionally characterised, and most are inorganic anion uptake transporters or anion:anion exchange transporters. Some transport their substrate(s) with high affinities, while others transport it or them with relatively low affinities. SLC26A/SulP family proteins consist of N-and C-termini flanking a transmembrane domain thought to span the lipid bilayer 10-14 times. In most cases, the C-terminal cytoplasmic region includes a STAS (sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist) domain. Malfunctions in members of the SLC26A family of anion transporters are involved in three human diseases: diastrophic dysplasia/achondrogenesis type 1B (DTDST), Pendred's syndrome (PDS) and congenital chloride diarrhoea (CLD). These proteins contain 12 transmembrane helices followed by a cytoplasmic STAS domain at the C terminus. The importance of the STAS domain in these transporters is illustrated by the fact that a number of mutations in PDS and DTDST map to it. Proteins in this family include:; SLC26A/SulP transporter domain; STAS domain: The STAS (Sulphate Transporter and AntiSigma factor antagonist) domain is found in the bacterial anti-sigma factor antagonists (ASA) and the C-terminal region of SLC26 (SulP) anion transporters. The activity of bacterial sigma transcription factors is controlled by a regulatory cascade involving an antisigma-factor, the antisigma-factor antagonist (ASA) and a phosphatase. The antisigma-factor binds to sigma and holds it in an inactive complex. The ASA can also interact with the anti-sigma-factor, allowing the release of the active sigma factor. As the antisigma-factor is a protein kinase, it can phosphorylate the antisigma antagonist on a conserved serine residue of the STAS domain. This phosphorylation inactivates the ASA that can be reactivated through dephosphorylation by a phosphatase. The STAS domain of the ASA SpoIIAA binds GTP and ATP and possesses a weak NTPase activity. Strong sequence conservation suggests that the STAS domain could possess general NTP-binding activity, and it has been proposed that the NTPs are likely to elicit specific conformational changes in the STAS domain through binding and/or hydrolysis. Resolution of the solution structure of the ASA SpoIIAA from Bacillus subtilis has shown that the STAS domain consists of a four-stranded β-sheet and four α-helices. The STAS domain forms a characteristic α-helical handle-like structure. The STAS domain of E. coli YchM protein, a SLC26 (SulP) family member, has been shown to interact with acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is an activated thiol ester carrier of acyl intermediates during fatty acid biosynthesis (FAB) and other acylation reactions. Malfunctions in members of the SLC26A family of anion transporters are involved in three human diseases: diastrophic dysplasia/achondrogenesis type 1B (DTDST), Pendred's syndrome (PDS) and congenital chloride diarrhea (CLD). These proteins contain 12 transmembrane helices followed by a cytoplasmic STAS domain at the C terminus. The importance of the STAS domain in these transporters is illustrated by the fact that a number of mutations in PDS and DTDST map to it.; Sulphate anion transporter, conserved site: A number of proteins involved in the transport of sulphate across a membrane as well as some yet uncharacterised proteins have been shown to be evolutionary related. These proteins are: These proteins are highly hydrophobic and seem to contain about 12 transmembrane domains.",

Members of this family are involved in forming the extracellular matrix, providing tensile strength, and facilitating cell adhesion. They contribute to the formation of fibrillar and network-forming collagen, which are essential for the architecture of connective tissues, such as bone, cartilage, skin, and tendons. Some family members are involved in specialized functions, such as the formation of the egg case wall in certain species, participating in the protective cuticle layer in nematodes, or playing roles in the immune system by acting as pattern recognition receptors. Additionally, certain collagens may interact with components of the neuromuscular junction and influence the assembly of amyloid fibrils, indicating a diverse range of biological activities beyond structural support.; Collagen triple helix repeat: Collagens are generally extracellular structural proteins involved in formation of connective tissue structure. The sequence is predominantly repeats of the G-X-Y and the polypeptide chains form a triple helix. The first position of the repeat is glycine, the second and third positions can be any residue but are frequently proline and hydroxyproline. Collagens are post-translationally modified by proline hydroxylase to form the hydroxyproline residues. Defective hydroxylation is the cause of scurvy. Members of this family belong to the collagen superfamily. Some of them are not involved in connective tissue structure but share the same triple helical structure.; Pancreatic trypsin inhibitor Kunitz domain: The majority of the sequences having this domain belong to the MEROPS inhibitor family I2, clan IB; the Kunitz/bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor family, they inhibit proteases of the S1 family and are restricted to the metazoa with a single exception: Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus. They are short (~50 residue) α/β proteins with few secondary structures. The fold is constrained by 3 disulphide bonds. The type example for this family is aprotinin (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) (or basic protease inhibitor), but the family includes numerous other members, such as snake venom basic protease; mammalian inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitors; trypstatin, a rodent mast cell inhibitor of trypsin; a domain found in an alternatively-spliced form of Alzheimer's amyloid beta-protein; domains at the C-termini of the alpha(1) and alpha(3) chains of type VII and type VI collagens; and tissue factor pathway inhibitor precursor. The pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) family is one of the numerous families of serine proteinase inhibitors. The basic structure of such a type of inhibitor is shown in the following schematic representation:; Proteinase inhibitor I2, Kunitz, conserved site: This entry represents a conserved site spanning a region starting after the third cysteine and ending with the fifth one.

Members of this family belong to the collagen superfamily. Some of them are not involved in connective tissue structure but share the same triple helical structure.; Fibronectin type III: Fibronectin is a dimeric glycoprotein composed of disulfide-linked subunits with a molecular weight of 220-250kDa each. It is involved in cell adhesion, cell morphology, thrombosis, cell migration, and embryonic differentiation. Fibronectin is a modular protein composed of homologous repeats of three prototypical types of domains known as types I, II, and III. Fibronectin type-III (FN3) repeats are both the largest and the most common of the fibronectin subdomains. Domains homologous to FN3 repeats have been found in various animal protein families including other extracellular-matrix molecules, cell-surface receptors, enzymes, and muscle proteins. Structures of individual FN3 domains have revealed a conserved β-sandwich fold with one β-sheet containing four strands and the other sheet containing three strands (see for example ). This fold is topologically very similar to that of Ig-like domains, with a notable difference being the lack of a conserved disulfide bond in FN3 domains. Distinctive hydrophobic core packing and the lack of detectable sequence homology between immunoglobulin and FN3 domains suggest, however, that these domains are not evolutionarily related. FN3 exhibits functional as well as structural modularity. Sites of interaction with other molecules have been mapped to short stretch of amino acids such as the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence found in various FN3 domains. The RGD sequences is involved in interactions with integrin. Small peptides containing the RGD sequence can modulate a variety of cell adhesion invents associated with thrombosis, inflammation, and tumour metastasis. These properties have led to the investigation of RGD peptides and RGD peptide analogues as potential therapeutic agents.; Immunoglobulin-like fold: This superfamily represents domains with an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) fold, which consists of a β-sandwich of seven or more strands in two sheets with a Greek-key topology. Ig-like domains are one of the most common protein modules found in animals, occurring in a variety of different proteins. These domains are often involved in interactions, commonly with other Ig-like domains via their β-sheets. Domains within this fold-family share the same structure, but can diverge with respect to their sequence. Based on sequence, Ig-like domains can be classified as V-set domains (antibody variable domain-like), C1-set domains (antibody constant domain-like), C2-set domains, and I-set domains (antibody intermediate domain-like). Proteins can contain more than one of these types of Ig-like domains. For example, in the human T-cell receptor antigen CD2, domain 1 (D1) is a V-set domain, while domain 2 (D2) is a C2-set domain, both domains having the same Ig-like fold. Domains with an Ig-like fold can be found in many, diverse proteins in addition to immunoglobulin molecules. For example, Ig-like domains occur in several different types of receptors (such as various T-cell antigen receptors), several cell adhesion molecules, MHC class I and II antigens, as well as the hemolymph protein hemolin, and the muscle proteins titin, telokin and twitchin.; Pancreatic trypsin inhibitor Kunitz domain: The majority of the sequences having this domain belong to the MEROPS inhibitor family I2, clan IB; the Kunitz/bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor family, they inhibit proteases of the S1 family and are restricted to the metazoa with a single exception: Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus. They are short (~50 residue) α/β proteins with few secondary structures. The fold is constrained by 3 disulphide bonds. The type example for this family is aprotinin (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) (or basic protease inhibitor), but the family includes numerous other members, such as snake venom basic protease; mammalian inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitors; trypstatin, a rodent mast cell inhibitor of trypsin; a domain found in an alternatively-spliced form of Alzheimer's amyloid beta-protein; domains at the C-termini of the alpha(1) and alpha(3) chains of type VII and type VI collagens; and tissue factor pathway inhibitor precursor. The pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) family is one of the numerous families of serine proteinase inhibitors. The basic structure of such a type of inhibitor is shown in the following schematic representation:; Proteinase inhibitor I2, Kunitz, conserved site: This entry represents a conserved site spanning a region starting after the third cysteine and ending with the fifth one. The majority of the sequences having this domain belong to the MEROPS inhibitor family I2, clan IB; the Kunitz/bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor family, they inhibit proteases of the S1 family and are restricted to the metazoa with a single exception: Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus. They are short (~50 residue) alpha/beta proteins with few secondary structures. The fold is constrained by 3 disulphide bonds. The type example for this family is aprotinin (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) (or basic protease inhibitor), but the family includes numerous other members, such as snake venom basic protease; mammalian inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitors; trypstatin, a rodent mast cell inhibitor of trypsin; a domain found in an alternatively-spliced form of Alzheimer's amyloid beta-protein; domains at the C-termini of the alpha(1) and alpha(3) chains of type VII and type VI collagens; and tissue factor pathway inhibitor precursor.; von Willebrand factor, type A: The von Willebrand factor is a large multimeric glycoprotein found in blood plasma. Mutant forms are involved in the aetiology of bleeding disorders. In von Willebrand factor, the type A domain (vWF) is the prototype for a protein superfamily. The vWF domain is found in various plasma proteins: complement factors B, C2, CR3 and CR4; the integrins (I-domains); collagen types VI, VII, XII and XIV; and other extracellular proteins. Although the majority of VWA-containing proteins are extracellular, the most ancient ones present in all eukaryotes are all intracellular proteins involved in functions such as transcription, DNA repair, ribosomal and membrane transport and the proteasome. A common feature appears to be involvement in multiprotein complexes. Proteins that incorporate vWF domains participate in numerous biological events (e.g. cell adhesion, migration, homing, pattern formation, and signal transduction), involving interaction with a large array of ligands. A number of human diseases arise from mutations in VWA domains.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in COL7A1; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Collagen and Collagen-like Structural Proteins: This family of proteins includes various types of collagen chains and collagen-like proteins that play crucial roles in the structural integrity and function of different tissues. Members of this family are involved in forming the extracellular matrix, providing tensile strength, and facilitating cell adhesion. They contribute to the formation of fibrillar and network-forming collagen, which are essential for the architecture of connective tissues, such as bone, cartilage, skin, and tendons. Some family members are involved in specialized functions, such as the formation of the egg case wall in certain species, participating in the protective cuticle layer in nematodes, or playing roles in the immune system by acting as pattern recognition receptors. Additionally, certain collagens may interact with components of the neuromuscular junction and influence the assembly of amyloid fibrils, indicating a diverse range of biological activities beyond structural support.; Collagen triple helix repeat: Collagens are generally extracellular structural proteins involved in formation of connective tissue structure. The sequence is predominantly repeats of the G-X-Y and the polypeptide chains form a triple helix. The first position of the repeat is glycine, the second and third positions can be any residue but are frequently proline and hydroxyproline. Collagens are post-translationally modified by proline hydroxylase to form the hydroxyproline residues. Defective hydroxylation is the cause of scurvy. Members of this family belong to the collagen superfamily. Some of them are not involved in connective tissue structure but share the same triple helical structure.; Fibronectin type III: Fibronectin is a dimeric glycoprotein composed of disulfide-linked subunits with a molecular weight of 220-250kDa each. It is involved in cell adhesion, cell morphology, thrombosis, cell migration, and embryonic differentiation. Fibronectin is a modular protein composed of homologous repeats of three prototypical types of domains known as types I, II, and III. Fibronectin type-III (FN3) repeats are both the largest and the most common of the fibronectin subdomains. Domains homologous to FN3 repeats have been found in various animal protein families including other extracellular-matrix molecules, cell-surface receptors, enzymes, and muscle proteins. Structures of individual FN3 domains have revealed a conserved β-sandwich fold with one β-sheet containing four strands and the other sheet containing three strands (see for example ). This fold is topologically very similar to that of Ig-like domains, with a notable difference being the lack of a conserved disulfide bond in FN3 domains. Distinctive hydrophobic core packing and the lack of detectable sequence homology between immunoglobulin and FN3 domains suggest, however, that these domains are not evolutionarily related. FN3 exhibits functional as well as structural modularity. Sites of interaction with other molecules have been mapped to short stretch of amino acids such as the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence found in various FN3 domains. The RGD sequences is involved in interactions with integrin. Small peptides containing the RGD sequence can modulate a variety of cell adhesion invents associated with thrombosis, inflammation, and tumour metastasis. These properties have led to the investigation of RGD peptides and RGD peptide analogues as potential therapeutic agents.; Immunoglobulin-like fold: This superfamily represents domains with an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) fold, which consists of a β-sandwich of seven or more strands in two sheets with a Greek-key topology.

These domains are often involved in interactions, commonly with other Ig-like domains via their β-sheets. Domains within this fold-family share the same structure, but can diverge with respect to their sequence. Based on sequence, Ig-like domains can be classified as V-set domains (antibody variable domain-like), C1-set domains (antibody constant domain-like), C2-set domains, and I-set domains (antibody intermediate domain-like). Proteins can contain more than one of these types of Ig-like domains. For example, in the human T-cell receptor antigen CD2, domain 1 (D1) is a V-set domain, while domain 2 (D2) is a C2-set domain, both domains having the same Ig-like fold. Domains with an Ig-like fold can be found in many, diverse proteins in addition to immunoglobulin molecules. For example, Ig-like domains occur in several different types of receptors (such as various T-cell antigen receptors), several cell adhesion molecules, MHC class I and II antigens, as well as the hemolymph protein hemolin, and the muscle proteins titin, telokin and twitchin.; Pancreatic trypsin inhibitor Kunitz domain: The majority of the sequences having this domain belong to the MEROPS inhibitor family I2, clan IB; the Kunitz/bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor family, they inhibit proteases of the S1 family and are restricted to the metazoa with a single exception: Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus. They are short (~50 residue) α/β proteins with few secondary structures. The fold is constrained by 3 disulphide bonds. The type example for this family is aprotinin (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) (or basic protease inhibitor), but the family includes numerous other members, such as snake venom basic protease; mammalian inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitors; trypstatin, a rodent mast cell inhibitor of trypsin; a domain found in an alternatively-spliced form of Alzheimer's amyloid beta-protein; domains at the C-termini of the alpha(1) and alpha(3) chains of type VII and type VI collagens; and tissue factor pathway inhibitor precursor. The pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) family is one of the numerous families of serine proteinase inhibitors. The basic structure of such a type of inhibitor is shown in the following schematic representation:; Proteinase inhibitor I2, Kunitz, conserved site: This entry represents a conserved site spanning a region starting after the third cysteine and ending with the fifth one.

Mutant forms are involved in the aetiology of bleeding disorders. In von Willebrand factor, the type A domain (vWF) is the prototype for a protein superfamily. The vWF domain is found in various plasma proteins: complement factors B, C2, CR3 and CR4; the integrins (I-domains); collagen types VI, VII, XII and XIV; and other extracellular proteins.

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in TGFBR2; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic; Phenotypes: Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection; Protein kinase domain: This entry represents the protein kinase domain containing the catalytic function of protein kinases. This domain is found in serine/threonine-protein kinases, tyrosine-protein kinases and dual specificity protein kinases. Eukaryotic protein kinases are enzymes that belong to a very extensive family of proteins which share a conserved catalytic core common with both serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases. There are a number of conserved regions in the catalytic domain of protein kinases. In the N-terminal extremity of the catalytic domain there is a glycine-rich stretch of residues in the vicinity of a lysine residue, which has been shown to be involved in ATP binding. In the central part of the catalytic domain there is a conserved aspartic acid residue which is important for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Protein phosphorylation, which plays a key role in most cellular activities, is a reversible process mediated by protein kinases and phosphoprotein phosphatases. Protein kinases catalyse the transfer of the gamma phosphate from nucleotide triphosphates (often ATP) to one or more amino acid residues in a protein substrate side chain, resulting in a conformational change affecting protein function. Phosphoprotein phosphatases catalyse the reverse process. Protein kinases fall into three broad classes, characterised with respect to substrate specificity: Protein kinase function is evolutionarily conserved from Escherichia coli to human. Protein kinases play a role in a multitude of cellular processes, including division, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Phosphorylation usually results in a functional change of the target protein by changing enzyme activity, cellular location, or association with other proteins. The catalytic subunits of protein kinases are highly conserved, and several structures have been solved, leading to large screens to develop kinase-specific inhibitors for the treatments of a number of diseases.; Protein kinase-like domain superfamily: Protein kinases modify other proteins by chemically adding phosphate groups to them. This process is fundamental to most signalling and regulatory processes in the eukaryotic cell.; Ser/Thr protein kinase, TGFB receptor: Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) forms a family with other growth factors. The receptors for most of the members of this growth factor family are related. These proteins are receptor-type kinases of Ser/Thr type, which have a single transmembrane domain and a specific hydrophilic Cys-rich ligand-binding domain. The C-terminal part of the extracellular domain is conserved. Some of the receptors of this family contain subclass-specific N-terminal extensions of this homology domain. The type I receptors also possess 7 extracellular residues preceding the cysteine box.; Serine-threonine/tyrosine-protein kinase, catalytic domain: This entry represents the catalytic domain found in a number of serine/threonine- and tyrosine-protein kinases. It does not include catalytic domain of dual specificity kinases. Protein phosphorylation, which plays a key role in most cellular activities, is a reversible process mediated by protein kinases and phosphoprotein phosphatases. Protein kinases catalyse the transfer of the gamma phosphate from nucleotide triphosphates (often ATP) to one or more amino acid residues in a protein substrate side chain, resulting in a conformational change affecting protein function. Phosphoprotein phosphatases catalyse the reverse process. Protein kinases fall into three broad classes, characterised with respect to substrate specificity: Protein kinase function is evolutionarily conserved from Escherichia coli to human. Protein kinases play a role in a multitude of cellular processes, including division, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Phosphorylation usually results in a functional change of the target protein by changing enzyme activity, cellular location, or association with other proteins. The catalytic subunits of protein kinases are highly conserved, and several structures have been solved, leading to large screens to develop kinase-specific inhibitors for the treatments of a number of diseases.; Transforming growth factor-beta receptor, type II: This entry represents the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta receptor type-2, which has serine/threonion kinase activity and uses magnesium or manganese as a cofactor. These proteins are the receptors for TGF-beta, a large family of growth and differentiation factors that mobilise complex signalling networks to regulate cellular differentiation, proliferation, motility, adhesion, and apoptosis. On ligand binding, the type-2 TGF-beta receptor forms a receptor complex consisting of two type II and two type I transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Type-2 receptors phosphorylate and activate type I receptors which autophosphorylate, then bind and activate SMAD transcriptional regulators.",

SNF2 functions as the ATPase component of the SNF2/SWI multisubunit complex, which utilises energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt histone-DNA interactions, resulting in the increased accessibility of DNA to transcription factors.; SNF2-like, N-terminal domain superfamily: This domain is found in proteins involved in a variety of processes including transcription regulation (e.g., SNF2, STH1, MOT1), DNA repair (e.g., RAD16, RAD5), DNA recombination (e.g., RAD54), and chromatin unwinding (e.g., ISWI) as well as a variety of other proteins with little functional information. SNF2 functions as the ATPase component of the SNF2/SWI multisubunit complex, which utilises energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt histone-DNA interactions, resulting in the increased accessibility of DNA to transcription factors. Proteins that contain this domain appear to be distantly related to the DEAX box helicases.; SNF2/RAD5-like, C-terminal helicase domain: This entry represents the C-terminal helicase domain of yeast DNA repair and recombination protein RAD54 and similar sequences from all domains in life. The Sucrose Non-Fermenting (SNF) family includes chromatin-remodeling factors, such as CHD proteins and SMARCA proteins, recombination proteins Rad54, and many others. They are DEAD-like helicases belonging to superfamily (SF)2, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. Similar to SF1 helicases, SF2 helicases do not form toroidal structures like SF3-6 helicases. Their helicase core consists of two similar protein domains that resemble the fold of the recombination protein RecA.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in PRKAR1A; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Carney complex, type 1; cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit: Protein phosphorylation, which plays a key role in most cellular activities, is a reversible process mediated by protein kinases and phosphoprotein phosphatases. Protein kinases catalyse the transfer of the gamma phosphate from nucleotide triphosphates (often ATP) to one or more amino acid residues in a protein substrate side chain, resulting in a conformational change affecting protein function. Phosphoprotein phosphatases catalyse the reverse process. Protein kinases fall into three broad classes, characterised with respect to substrate specificity: Protein kinase function is evolutionarily conserved from Escherichia coli to human. Protein kinases play a role in a multitude of cellular processes, including division, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Phosphorylation usually results in a functional change of the target protein by changing enzyme activity, cellular location, or association with other proteins. The catalytic subunits of protein kinases are highly conserved, and several structures have been solved, leading to large screens to develop kinase-specific inhibitors for the treatments of a number of diseases. In the absence of cAMP, protein kinase A (PKA) exists as an equimolar tetramer of regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) subunits. In addition to its role as an inhibitor of the C subunit, the R subunit anchors the holoenzyme to specific intracellular locations and prevents the C subunit from entering the nucleus. Typical R subunits have a conserved domain structure, consisting of the N-terminal dimerisation domain, inhibitory region, cAMP-binding domain A and cAMP-binding domain B. R subunits interact with C subunits primarily through the inhibitory site. The cAMP-binding domains show extensive sequence similarity and bind cAMP cooperatively. On the basis of phylogenetic trees generated from multiple sequence alignment of complete sequences, this family was divided into four sub-families, types I to IV. Types I and II, found in animals, differ in molecular weight, sequence, autophosphorylation capability, cellular location and tissue distribution. Types I and II are further sub-divided into alpha and beta subtypes, based mainly on sequence similarity. Type III are from fungi and type IV are from alveolates.; cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit-like: cAMP-dependent kinase regulatory subunits play a crucial role in cAMP signaling within cells. They are involved in the regulation of protein kinases (PKA) activity by inhibiting the kinase in the absence of cAMP. Upon binding of cAMP, these regulatory subunits undergo a conformational change that leads to the dissociation of the regulatory subunit dimer from the catalytic subunits, thus activating the kinase. This family is involved in various cellular processes including the regulation of metabolic pathways, cell growth, and proliferation, as well as the rhythmic contraction of muscles and neuronal activity regulation in the brain. This entry also contains cAMP/cGMP-dependent 3',5'-cAMP/cGMP phosphodiesterase B, thought to function as a cAMP-stimulated cAMP-phosphodiesterase which may play a role in regulating the cAMP relay response. Acetyltransferase Pat catalyses the acetylation of the epsilon-amino group of a highly conserved lysine residue in acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and of the universal stress protein (USP) MSMEG_4207. Acetylation results in the inactivation of ACS activity and could be important for mycobacteria to adjust to environmental changes.; Cyclic nucleotide-binding domain: Proteins that bind cyclic nucleotides (cAMP or cGMP) share a structural domain of about 120 residues. The best studied of these proteins is the prokaryotic catabolite gene activator (also known as the cAMP receptor protein) (gene crp) where such a domain is known to be composed of three α-helices and a distinctive eight-stranded, antiparallel β-barrel structure. There are six invariant amino acids in this domain, three of which are glycine residues that are thought to be essential for maintenance of the structural integrity of the β-barrel. cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cAPK and cGPK) contain two tandem copies of the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain. The cAPK's are composed of two different subunits, a catalytic chain and a regulatory chain, which contains both copies of the domain. The cGPK's are single chain enzymes that include the two copies of the domain in their N-terminal section. Vertebrate cyclic nucleotide-gated ion-channels also contain this domain. Two such cations channels have been fully characterised, one is found in rod cells where it plays a role in visual signal transduction.; RmlC-like jelly roll fold: RmlC (deoxythymidine diphosphates-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase; ) is a mainly beta class protein with a jelly roll-like topology. It is a dTDP-sugar isomerase enzyme involved in the synthesis of L-rhamnose, a saccharide required for the virulence of some pathogenic bacteria. This entry represents the domain with the jelly roll-like fold.",

Asparagine synthetase B catalyses the assembly of asparagine from aspartate, Mg(2+)ATP, and glutamine. The three-dimensional architecture of the N-terminal domain of asparagine synthetase B is similar to that observed for glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase while the molecular motif of the C-domain is reminiscent to that observed for GMP synthetase. Asparagine synthetase B catalyses the ATP-dependent conversion of aspartate to asparagine. This enzyme is a homodimer, with each monomer composed of a glutaminase domain and a synthetase domain. The N-terminal glutaminase domain hydrolyzes glutamine to glutamic acid and ammonia.; Asparagine synthase, glutamine-hydrolyzing: These sequences represent glutamine-hydrolysing asparagine synthase. The group have a poorly conserved C-terminal extension while bacterial members of the family tend to have a long, poorly conserved insert lacking from archaeal and eukaryotic sequences. Multiple isozymes have been demonstrated, such as in Bacillus subtilis.; Asparagine Synthetase: The asparagine synthetase family is involved in the biosynthesis of asparagine, a process that is essential for nitrogen assimilation, distribution, and remobilization within organisms. Members of this family catalyze the ATP-dependent conversion of aspartate to asparagine using glutamine as a nitrogen source. Some family members can also use ammonia as a nitrogen source. This reaction is crucial in various biological contexts, including plant nitrogen transport via the phloem and potentially in the remobilization of nitrogen during senescence in flowers. Additionally, related enzymes within this family are involved in the biosynthesis of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as carbapenem, by catalyzing the formation of specific intermediates.; Rossmann-like alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold: This superfamily represents domains related by a common ancestor that have a Rossmann-like, 3-layer, α/β/α sandwich fold.

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in SMARCAL1; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic; Phenotypes: Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia; HARP domain: SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A-like1), also known as DNA-dependent ATPase A and HARP (Hep-A-related proteins), maintains genome integrity during DNA replication. SMARCAL1 has ATP-dependent annealing helicase activity, which helps to stabilise stalled replication forks and facilitate DNA repair during replication. Biochemically, SMARCAL1 can bind to DNA that contains single- and double-stranded regions such as forks and DNA hairpins. DNA binding activates its ATPase activity, and this activity promotes DNA single-stranded annealing. SMARCAL1 is a multifunctional protein. The ATPase domain, which lies in the C- terminal half of the protein, is split into two regions of primary amino acid sequence by a 115-amino-acid linker sequence. The N-terminal half of the protein contains a highly sequence conserved ssDNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA)-binding domain, and one or two HARP domain(s). The evolutionarily conserved HARP domain determines the annealing helicase activity required for the in vivo and in vitro functions of SMARCAL1.; Helicase superfamily 1/2, ATP-binding domain: This entry represents the DNA-binding domain of classical SF1 and SF2 helicases. It does not recognise bacterial DinG and eukaryotic Rad3 which differ from other SF1-SF2 helicases by the presence of a large insert after the Walker A (see ). Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). All of the proteins bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A (phosphate-binding loop or P-loop) and Walker B (Mg2+-binding aspartic acid) motifs. For the two largest groups, commonly referred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been identified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses that seem to be active as monomers or dimers. RNA and DNA helicases are considered to be enzymes that catalyse the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in an energy-dependent manner. The various structures of SF1 and SF2 helicases present a common core with two α-β RecA-like domains. The structural homology with the RecA recombination protein covers the five contiguous parallel β-strands and the tandem α-helices. ATP binds to the amino proximal α-β domain, where the Walker A (motif I) and Walker B (motif II) are found. The N-terminal domain also contains motif III (S-A-T) which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities. The carboxy-terminal α-β domain is structurally very similar to the proximal one even though it is bereft of an ATP-binding site, suggesting that it may have originally arisen through gene duplication of the first one. Some members of helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 are listed below:; Helicase, C-terminal domain-like: Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). For the two largest groups, commonly referred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been identified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses. This entry represents the C-terminal domain found in proteins belonging to the helicase superfamilies 1 and 2. Included in this group is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), a member of the DEA(D/H)-box RNA helicase family. The structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of eIF4A has been determined; it has a parallel α-β topology that superimposes, with minor variations, on the structures and conserved motifs of the equivalent domain in other, distantly related helicases.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.; SNF2, N-terminal: This domain is found in proteins involved in a variety of processes including transcription regulation (e.g., SNF2, STH1, brahma, MOT1), DNA repair (e.g., ERCC6, RAD16, RAD5), DNA recombination (e.g., RAD54), and chromatin unwinding (e.g., ISWI) as well as a variety of other proteins with little functional information (e.g., lodestar, ETL1). SNF2 functions as the ATPase component of the SNF2/SWI multisubunit complex, which utilises energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt histone-DNA interactions, resulting in the increased accessibility of DNA to transcription factors.; SNF2-like, N-terminal domain superfamily: This domain is found in proteins involved in a variety of processes including transcription regulation (e.g., SNF2, STH1, MOT1), DNA repair (e.g., RAD16, RAD5), DNA recombination (e.g., RAD54), and chromatin unwinding (e.g., ISWI) as well as a variety of other proteins with little functional information. SNF2 functions as the ATPase component of the SNF2/SWI multisubunit complex, which utilises energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt histone-DNA interactions, resulting in the increased accessibility of DNA to transcription factors. Proteins that contain this domain appear to be distantly related to the DEAX box helicases.; SNF2/RAD5-like, C-terminal helicase domain: This entry represents the C-terminal helicase domain of yeast DNA repair and recombination protein RAD54 and similar sequences from all domains in life. The Sucrose Non-Fermenting (SNF) family includes chromatin-remodeling factors, such as CHD proteins and SMARCA proteins, recombination proteins Rad54, and many others. They are DEAD-like helicases belonging to superfamily (SF)2, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. Similar to SF1 helicases, SF2 helicases do not form toroidal structures like SF3-6 helicases. Their helicase core consists of two similar protein domains that resemble the fold of the recombination protein RecA.",

It has been proposed that this domain is formed of two amphipathic helices joined by a variable length linker region that could form a loop. This 'helix-loop-helix' (HLH) domain mediates protein dimerisation and has been found in the proteins listed below. Most of these proteins have an extra basic region of about 15 amino acid residues that is adjacent to the HLH domain and specifically binds to DNA. They are referred as basic helix-loop-helix proteins (bHLH), and are classified in two groups: class A (ubiquitous) and class B (tissue-specific). Members of the bHLH family bind variations on the core sequence 'CANNTG', also referred to as the E-box motif. The homo- or heterodimerisation mediated by the HLH domain is independent of, but necessary for DNA binding, as two basic regions are required for DNA binding activity. The HLH proteins lacking the basic domain (Emc, Id) function as negative regulators, since they form heterodimers, but fail to bind DNA. The hairy-related proteins (hairy, E(spl), deadpan) also repress transcription although they can bind DNA. The proteins of this subfamily act together with co-repressor proteins, like groucho, through their -terminal motif WRPW.; Myc-type, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain; Neuronal Differentiation E-box Binding Transcription Factors: The protein family is comprised of transcription factors involved in the initiation of neuronal differentiation and various developmental processes. Members of the family are characterized by their ability to bind to E-box motifs (5'-CANNTG-3') in the promoter regions of target genes, thereby activating transcription. They play roles in the development of the GnRH axis, neuronal plasticity, and tissue-specific cell fate determination during embryogenesis, such as muscle or early B-cell differentiation. Some family members also participate in mesenchymal to epithelial transition and may interact with other proteins like ATOH7, MYOD1, and CDP2 to regulate gene expression. The presence of a 9aaTAD motif suggests a transactivation function. The family is also implicated in sex determination and may influence lifespan and metabolism.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in BLM; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Bloom syndrome; ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecQ, zinc-binding domain: This domain is the zinc-binding domain of ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecQ.; BDHCT: This is a C-terminal domain in RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM subfamily. The helicase participates in DNA replication and repair, exhibiting a magnesium-dependent ATP-dependent DNA-helicase activity that unwinds single- and double-stranded DNA in a 3'-5' direction.; DEAD/DEAH-box helicase domain: This entry represents the DNA-binding domain at the N-terminal in DEAD/DEAH box helicase and related proteins. This domain also contains motif III (S-A-T) which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities. DEAD-box and DEAH-box RNA helicases are essential enzymes involved in the unwinding of nucleic acids, playing critical roles in RNA metabolism. The DEAD-box helicases, exemplified by the translation initiation factor eIF4A, are RNA-dependent ATPases that act as RNA helicases in conjunction with eIF4B. These proteins participate in a wide range of processes including nuclear transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, nucleocytoplasmic transport, translation, RNA decay and organellar gene expression. In contrast, DEAH-box helicases are primarily involved in pre-mRNA splicing and function as ATP-dependent RNA helicases.; DNA helicase, ATP-dependent, RecQ type: The ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecQ is involved in genome maintenance. All homologues tested to date unwind paired DNA, translocating in a 3' to 5' direction and several have a preference for forked or 4-way DNA structures (e.g. Holliday junctions) or for G-quartet DNA. The yeast protein, Sgs1, is present in numerous foci that coincide with sites of de novo synthesis DNA, such as the replication fork, and protein levels peak during S-phase. A model has been proposed for Sgs1p action in the S-phase checkpoint response, both as a 'sensor' for damage during replication and a 'resolvase' for structures that arise at paused forks, such as the four-way 'chickenfoot' structure. The action of Sgs1p may serve to maintain the proper amount and integrity of ss DNA that is necessary for the binding of RPA (replication protein A, the eukaryotic ss DNA-binding protein)-DNA pol complexes. Sgs1p would thus function by detecting (or resolving) aberrant DNA structures, and would thus contribute to the full activation of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, Mec1p and the effector kinase, Rad53p. Its ability to bind both the large subunit of RPA and the RecA-like protein Rad51p, place it in a unique position to resolve inappropriate fork structures that can occur when either the leading or lagging strand synthesis is stalled. Thus, RecQ helicases integrate checkpoint activation and checkpoint response.; DNA/RNA helicase, ATP-dependent, DEAH-box type, conserved site: A number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins have been characterised on the basis of their structural similarity. They all seem to be involved in ATP-dependent, nucleic-acid unwinding. There are two subfamilies of such proteins, the D-E-A-D-box and D-E-A-H-box families. Proteins that belong to the subfamily which have His instead of the second Asp are said to be 'D-E-A-H-box' proteins. Proteins currently known to belong to this subfamily include yeast PRP2, PRP16, PRP22 and PRP43, involved in various ATP-requiring steps of the pre-mRNA splicing process; fission yeast prh1, which my be involved in pre-mRNA splicing; Drosophila male-less (mle) protein required in males for dosage compensation of X chromosome linked genes; yeast RAD3, a DNA helicase involved in excision repair of DNA damaged by UV light, bulky adducts or cross-linking agents; fission yeast rad15 (rhp3) and mammalian DNA excision repair protein XPD (ERCC-2); yeast CHL1 (or CTF1), which is important for chromosome transmission and normal cell cycle progression in G(2)/M; yeast TPS1, Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins C06E1.10 and K03H1.2; Poxviruses' early transcription factor 70kDa subunit which acts with RNA polymerase to initiate transcription from early gene promoters; Vaccinia virus putative helicase I8; and Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase hrpA. All these proteins share a number of conserved sequence motifs. Some of them are specific to this family while others are shared by other ATP-binding proteins or by proteins belonging to the helicases 'superfamily'.; Helicase superfamily 1/2, ATP-binding domain: This entry represents the DNA-binding domain of classical SF1 and SF2 helicases. It does not recognise bacterial DinG and eukaryotic Rad3 which differ from other SF1-SF2 helicases by the presence of a large insert after the Walker A (see ). Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). All of the proteins bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A (phosphate-binding loop or P-loop) and Walker B (Mg2+-binding aspartic acid) motifs. For the two largest groups, commonly referred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been identified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses that seem to be active as monomers or dimers. RNA and DNA helicases are considered to be enzymes that catalyse the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in an energy-dependent manner. The various structures of SF1 and SF2 helicases present a common core with two α-β RecA-like domains. The structural homology with the RecA recombination protein covers the five contiguous parallel β-strands and the tandem α-helices. ATP binds to the amino proximal α-β domain, where the Walker A (motif I) and Walker B (motif II) are found. The N-terminal domain also contains motif III (S-A-T) which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities. The carboxy-terminal α-β domain is structurally very similar to the proximal one even though it is bereft of an ATP-binding site, suggesting that it may have originally arisen through gene duplication of the first one. Some members of helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 are listed below:; Helicase, C-terminal domain-like: Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). For the two largest groups, commonly referred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been identified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses. This entry represents the C-terminal domain found in proteins belonging to the helicase superfamilies 1 and 2. Included in this group is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), a member of the DEA(D/H)-box RNA helicase family. The structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of eIF4A has been determined; it has a parallel α-β topology that superimposes, with minor variations, on the structures and conserved motifs of the equivalent domain in other, distantly related helicases.; HRDC domain: The HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain is comprised of two orthogonally packed α-hairpin subdomains, and is involved in interactions with DNA and protein. It has been suggested that this domain plays a role dissolving double Holliday junctions efficiently. HRDC domains are found at the C terminus of many RecQ helicases, including the human Bifunctional 3'-5' exonuclease/ATP-dependent helicase WRN and RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM. RecQ helicases have been shown to unwind DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. The structure of the HRDC domain consists of a 4-5 helical bundle of two orthogonally packed α-hairpins, and as such it resembles auxiliary domains in bacterial DNA helicases and other proteins that interact with nucleic acids. A positively charged region on the surface of the HRDC domain is able to interact with DNA. The HRDC domain is also present in eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerase II subunit RBP4, the N-terminal of which forms a heterodimerisation α-hairpin. The HRDC domain has a putative role in nucleic acid binding. Mutations in the HRDC domain associated with the human BLM gene result in Bloom Syndrome (BS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by proportionate pre- and postnatal growth deficiency; sun-sensitive, telangiectatic, hypo- and hyperpigmented skin; predisposition to malignancy; and chromosomal instability.; HRDC-like superfamily: This superfamily represents the HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain, which comprises two orthogonally packed α-hairpin subdomains, and is involved in interactions with DNA and protein. The HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain is found at the C terminus of many RecQ helicases, including the human Bifunctional 3'-5' exonuclease/ATP-dependent helicase WRN and RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM (previously known as Werner and Bloom syndrome proteins). RecQ helicases have been shown to unwind DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. The structure of the HRDC domain consists of a 4-5 helical bundle of two orthogonally packed α-hairpins, and as such it resembles auxiliary domains in bacterial DNA helicases and other proteins that interact with nucleic acids. A positively charged region on the surface of the HRDC domain is able to interact with DNA. The HRDC domain is also present in eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerase II subunit RBP4, the N-terminal of which forms a heterodimerisation α-hairpin.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.; RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM, BDHCT-box associated domain: This domain is found on RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM in higher eukaryotes. It lies between the BDHCT, and DEAD-box domains. This domain, together with, may play a role in regulation and oligomerization of BLM. These domains are also important in mediating interactions with partner proteins.; RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM, N-terminal domain: This is the very N-terminal region of chordate RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM proteins. BLM participates in DNA replication and repair. This domain, together with, may play a role in regulation and oligomerization of BLM. These domains are also important in mediating interactions with partner proteins.; RQC domain: This entry represents the RQC domain, which is a DNA-binding domain found only in RecQ family enzymes. RecQ family helicases can unwind G4 DNA, and play important roles at G-rich domains of the genome, including the telomeres, rDNA, and immunoglobulin switch regions. This domain has a helix-turn-helix structure and acts as a high affinity G4 DNA binding domain. Binding of RecQ to Holliday junctions involves both the RQC and the HRDC domains.; Winged helix DNA-binding domain superfamily: Winged helix DNA-binding proteins share a related winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, where the \"wings\", or loops, are small β-sheets. The winged helix motif consists of two wings (W1, W2), three α-helices (H1, H2, H3) and three β-sheets (S1, S2, S3) arranged in the order H1-S1-H2-H3-S2-W1-S3-W2. The DNA-recognition helix makes sequence-specific DNA contacts with the major groove of DNA, while the wings make different DNA contacts, often with the minor groove or the backbone of DNA. Several winged-helix proteins display an exposed patch of hydrophobic residues thought to mediate protein-protein interactions.; Winged helix-like DNA-binding domain superfamily: Winged helix DNA-binding proteins share a related winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, where the \"wings\", or loops, are small β-sheets. The winged helix motif consists of two wings (W1, W2), three α-helices (H1, H2, H3) and three β-sheets (S1, S2, S3) arranged in the order H1-S1-H2-H3-S2-W1-S3-W2. The DNA-recognition helix makes sequence-specific DNA contacts with the major groove of DNA, while the wings make different DNA contacts, often with the minor groove or the backbone of DNA. Several winged-helix proteins display an exposed patch of hydrophobic residues thought to mediate protein-protein interactions. Many different proteins with diverse biological functions contain a winged helix DNA-binding domain, including transcriptional repressors such as biotin repressor, LexA repressor and the arginine repressor; transcription factors such as the hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 proteins involved in cell differentiation, heat-shock transcription factor, and the general transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIF; helicases such as RuvB that promotes branch migration at the Holliday junction, and CDC6 in the pre-replication complex; endonucleases such as FokI and TnsA; histones; and Mu transposase, where the flexible wing of the enhancer-binding domain is essential for efficient transposition.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in TAP1; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: MHC class I deficiency; AAA+ ATPase domain: This entry represents the AAA+ ATPase domain found in a range of proteins, including Holliday junction ATP-dependent DNA helicase RuvB from Mycobacterium sp, ATP synthases, and related ATP-dependent proteins. The proteins in this superfamily are characterised by the structural conservation of a central ATPase domain of about 250 amino acids called the AAA module. Typically, the AAA domain can be divided into two structural subdomains, an N-terminal P-loop NTPase α-β-α subdomain that is connected to a smaller C-terminal all-α subdomain. The α-β-α subdomain adopts a Rossman fold and contains several motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, including classical motifs Walker A and Walker B. The all-α subdomain, is much less conserved across AAA proteins. The AAA+ superfamily of ATPases is found in all kingdoms of living organisms where they participate in diverse cellular processes including membrane fusion, proteolysis and DNA replication. Although the terms AAA+ and AAA are often used loosely and interchangeably, the classical AAA family members are distinguished by their possession of the SRH region in the AAA module. Many AAA+ proteins are involved in similar processes to those of AAA proteins (facilitation of protein folding and unfolding, assembly or disassembly of proteins complexes, protein transport and degradation), but others function in replication, recombination, repair and transcription. For a review see.; ABC transporter Tap-like: The ABC transporter family is a group of membrane proteins that use the hydrolysis of ATP to power the translocation of a wide variety of substrates across cellular membranes. ABC transporters minimally consist of two conserved regions: a highly conserved nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). Eukaryotic ABC proteins are usually organised either as full transporters (containing two NBDs and two TMDs), or as half transporters (containing one NBD and one TMD), that have to form homo- or heterodimers in order to constitute a functional protein. This entry includes Tap1/2 (transporter associated with antigen processing 1/2) and its homologue, Mdl2, from budding yeasts. They are a group of eukaryotic proteins belonging to the ABC transporter family. Tap proteins play a crucial role in the processing and presentation of the MHC class I-restricted antigens. Mdl2 is a mitochondrial inner membrane half-type ABC transporter that is required for respiratory growth at high temperature.; ABC transporter-like, ATP-binding domain: This entry represents a conserved region found in a group of related ATP-binding proteins and is associated with ATP-binding. The proteins belonging to this group also contain one or two copies of the 'A' consensus sequence or the 'P-loop' sequence motif. ABC transporters belong to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily, which uses the hydrolysis of ATP to energise diverse biological systems. ABC transporters minimally consist of two conserved regions: a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). These can be found on the same protein or on two different ones. Most ABC transporters function as a dimer and therefore are constituted of four domains, two ABC modules and two TMDs. ABC transporters are involved in the export or import of a wide variety of substrates ranging from small ions to macromolecules. The major function of ABC import systems is to provide essential nutrients to bacteria. They are found only in prokaryotes and their four constitutive domains are usually encoded by independent polypeptides (two ABC proteins and two TMD proteins). Prokaryotic importers require additional extracytoplasmic binding proteins (one or more per systems) for function. In contrast, export systems are involved in the extrusion of noxious substances, the export of extracellular toxins and the targeting of membrane components. They are found in all living organisms and in general the TMD is fused to the ABC module in a variety of combinations. Some eukaryotic exporters encode the four domains on the same polypeptide chain. The ABC module (approximately two hundred amino acid residues) is known to bind and hydrolyse ATP, thereby coupling transport to ATP hydrolysis in a large number of biological processes. The cassette is duplicated in several subfamilies. Its primary sequence is highly conserved, displaying a typical phosphate-binding loop: Walker A, and a magnesium binding site: Walker B. Besides these two regions, three other conserved motifs are present in the ABC cassette: the switch region which contains a histidine loop, postulated to polarise the attaching water molecule for hydrolysis, the signature conserved motif (LSGGQ) specific to the ABC transporter, and the Q-motif (between Walker A and the signature), which interacts with the gamma phosphate through a water bond. The Walker A, Walker B, Q-loop and switch region form the nucleotide binding site. The 3D structure of a monomeric ABC module adopts a stubby L-shape with two distinct arms. ArmI (mainly β-strand) contains Walker A and Walker B. The important residues for ATP hydrolysis and/or binding are located in the P-loop. The ATP-binding pocket is located at the extremity of armI. The perpendicular armII contains mostly the α helical subdomain with the signature motif. It only seems to be required for structural integrity of the ABC module. ArmII is in direct contact with the TMD. The hinge between armI and armII contains both the histidine loop and the Q-loop, making contact with the gamma phosphate of the ATP molecule. ATP hydrolysis leads to a conformational change that could facilitate ADP release. In the dimer the two ABC cassettes contact each other through hydrophobic interactions at the antiparallel β-sheet of armI by a two-fold axis. The ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily forms one of the largest of all protein families with a diversity of physiological functions. Several studies have shown that there is a correlation between the functional characterisation and the phylogenetic classification of the ABC cassette. More than 50 subfamilies have been described based on a phylogenetic and functional classification.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.; Type 1 protein exporter: Proteins in this entry are required for type I protein secretion and have an N-terminal ABC transporter type 1 transmembrane domain and a C-terminal P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase domain. The transmembrane domain forms a pore in the inner membrane and the ATP-binding domain is responsible for energy generation. Sequences are mainly from bacteria, but there are homologues from eukaryotes and archaea. Proteins in this entry include the following:",

Dyneins generally contain one to three heavy chains, where each heavy chain consists of a C-terminal globular head, a flexible microtubule-binding stalk, and a flexible N-terminal tail known as the cargo-binding domain. The two categories of dyneins are the axonemal dyneins, which produce the bending motions that propagate along cilia and flagella, and the cytosolic dyneins, which drive a variety of fundamental cellular processes including nuclear migration, organisation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome separation during mitosis, and the positioning and function of many intracellular organelles. Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain: This family represents the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain. This domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domain.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain, barrel region: Dyneins are microtubule-based AAA motor complexes that power ciliary beating, cell division, cell migration and intracellular transport. The motor domain comprises the AAA ring and three additional structural units: the linker, stalk/strut (both of which are major functional units of the heavy chain) and C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domains. This entry represents the barrel region of the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in NF1; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Neurofibromatosis, type 1; Armadillo-type fold: This entry represents a structural domain with an armadillo (ARM)-like fold, consisting of a multi-helical fold comprised of two curved layers of α-helices arranged in a regular right-handed superhelix, where the repeats that make up this structure are arranged about a common axis. These superhelical structures present an extensive solvent-accessible surface that is well suited to binding large substrates such as proteins and nucleic acids. The sequence similarity among these different repeats or domains is low, however they exhibit considerable structural similarity. Furthermore, the number of repeats present in the superhelical structure can vary between orthologues, indicating that rapid loss/gain of repeats has occurred frequently in evolution. A common phylogenetic origin has been proposed for the armadillo and HEAT repeats.; CRAL-TRIO lipid binding domain: The CRAL-TRIO domain is a protein structural domain that binds small lipophilic molecules. The domain is named after cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) and TRIO guanine exchange factor. The CRAL-TRIO domain is found in GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and a family of hydrophobic ligand binding proteins, including the yeast SEC14 protein and mammalian retinaldehyde- and alpha-tocopherol-binding proteins. The domain may either constitute all of the protein or only part of it. The structure of the domain in SEC14 proteins has been determined. The structure contains several α helices as well as a β sheet composed of 6 strands. Strands 2,3,4 and 5 form a parallel β sheet with strands 1 and 6 being anti-parallel. The structure also identified a hydrophobic binding pocket for lipid binding.; Neurofibromin, PH domain-like: This entry represents the pleckstrin homology (PH)-like domain of neurofibromin (NF1) and similar sequences from animals and fungi. Neurofibromin is a Ras-specific GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP). Mutations in the gene encoding this protein cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). This domain forms a bipartite module with the Sec14p homologous segment, which together exhibit phospholipid binding activity. The domain interface architecture suggests a model of how the NF1 PH domain may regulate binding of a ligand by the Sec14 module.; PH-like domain superfamily: This superfamily represents the PH domain and structurally related domains. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are small modular domains that occur in a large variety of signalling proteins, where they serve as simple targeting domains that bind lipids. PH domains have a partly opened β-barrel topology that is capped by an α-helix. The structure of PH domains is similar to the phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) found in IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), Shc adaptor and Numb; to the Ran-binding domain, found in Nup nuclear pore complex and Ranbp1; to the Enabled/VASP homology domain 1 (EVH1 domain), found in Enabled, VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein), Homer and WASP actin regulatory protein; and to the third domain of FERM, found in moesin, radixin, ezrin, merlin and talin.; Ras GTPase-activating domain: This entry represents a conserved domain in the RasGAPs (Ras GTPase-activating proteins). This domain is also known as the RasGAP domain. Ras proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that bind GTP and GDP and slowly hydrolyze GTP to GDP. This intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras is regulated by a family of proteins collectively known as 'GAP' or GTPase-activating proteins. RasGAP proteins are usually quite large (from 765 residues for sar1 to 3079 residues for IRA2) but share only a limited (about 250 residues) region of sequence similarity, referred to as the 'catalytic domain' or RasGAP domain. The most conserved region within this domain contains a 15 residue motif which seems to be characteristic of this family of proteins.; Ras GTPase-activating protein: Ras proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that bind GTP and GDP and slowly hydrolyze GTP to GDP. This intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras is regulated by a family of proteins collectively known as 'GAP' or GTPase-activating proteins. RasGAP proteins are usually quite large (from 765 residues for sar1 to 3079 residues for IRA2) but share only a limited (about 250 residues) region of sequence similarity, referred to as the 'catalytic domain' or RasGAP domain. The most conserved region within this domain contains a 15 residue motif which seems to be characteristic of this family of proteins.; Ras GTPase-activating protein, conserved site: This entry represents a conserved site in the RasGAPs (Ras GTPase-activating proteins).; Rho GTPase activation protein: Proteins containing a RhoGAP (Rho GTPase Activating Protein) domain usually function to catalyse the hydrolysis of GTP that is bound to Rho, Rac and/or Cdc42, inactivating these regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. The 53 known human RhoGAP domain-containing proteins are the largest known group of Rho GTPase regulators and significantly outnumber the 21 Rho GTPases they presumably regulate. This excess of GAP proteins probably indicates complex regulation of the Rho GTPases and is consistent with the existence of almost as many (48) human Dbl domain-containing Rho GEFs that act antagonistically to the RhoGAP proteins by activating the Rho GTPases. Phylogenetic analysis offers evidence for frequent domain duplication and for duplication of the entire genes containing these GAP domains.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in FANCD2; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Fanconi anemia; Fanconi anaemia protein FANCD2: The Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway is responsible for interstrand crosslink DNA repair. The name originates the recessive syndrome known as Fanconi anemia, which causes developmental problems and cancer predisposition. In this pathway, the FANCI-FANCD2 (ID) complex is ubiquitinated by the FA core complex and then travels to sites of damage to coordinate repair. FA pathway activation seems to trigger dissociation of FANCD2 from FANCI, coinciding with FANCD2 monoubiquitination which precedes monoubiquitination of FANCI. This suggests a functional separation for FANCD2 from FANCI. Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 functions to recruit DNA repair factors FAN1 (Fanconi-associated nuclease 1) and SLX4, suggesting that chromatin-bound FANCD2Ub is a docking platform for certain DNA repair nucleases. FANCD2 has also a role in replication fork recovery.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in ASNS; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Asparagine synthase: Family members that contain this domain catalyse the conversion of aspartate to asparagine. Asparagine synthetase B catalyses the assembly of asparagine from aspartate, Mg(2+)ATP, and glutamine. The three-dimensional architecture of the N-terminal domain of asparagine synthetase B is similar to that observed for glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase while the molecular motif of the C-domain is reminiscent to that observed for GMP synthetase. Asparagine synthetase B catalyses the ATP-dependent conversion of aspartate to asparagine. This enzyme is a homodimer, with each monomer composed of a glutaminase domain and a synthetase domain. The N-terminal glutaminase domain hydrolyzes glutamine to glutamic acid and ammonia.; Asparagine synthase, glutamine-hydrolyzing: These sequences represent glutamine-hydrolysing asparagine synthase. The group have a poorly conserved C-terminal extension while bacterial members of the family tend to have a long, poorly conserved insert lacking from archaeal and eukaryotic sequences. Multiple isozymes have been demonstrated, such as in Bacillus subtilis.; Asparagine Synthetase: The asparagine synthetase family is involved in the biosynthesis of asparagine, a process that is essential for nitrogen assimilation, distribution, and remobilization within organisms. Members of this family catalyze the ATP-dependent conversion of aspartate to asparagine using glutamine as a nitrogen source. Some family members can also use ammonia as a nitrogen source. This reaction is crucial in various biological contexts, including plant nitrogen transport via the phloem and potentially in the remobilization of nitrogen during senescence in flowers. Additionally, related enzymes within this family are involved in the biosynthesis of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as carbapenem, by catalyzing the formation of specific intermediates.; Rossmann-like alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold: This superfamily represents domains related by a common ancestor that have a Rossmann-like, 3-layer, α/β/α sandwich fold. Protein families in which the domain is found include:",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in DNAH11; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic; Phenotypes: Primary ciliary dyskinesia; Primary ciliary dyskinesia 7; AAA+ ATPase domain: This entry represents the AAA+ ATPase domain found in a range of proteins, including Holliday junction ATP-dependent DNA helicase RuvB from Mycobacterium sp, ATP synthases, and related ATP-dependent proteins. The proteins in this superfamily are characterised by the structural conservation of a central ATPase domain of about 250 amino acids called the AAA module. Typically, the AAA domain can be divided into two structural subdomains, an N-terminal P-loop NTPase α-β-α subdomain that is connected to a smaller C-terminal all-α subdomain. The α-β-α subdomain adopts a Rossman fold and contains several motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, including classical motifs Walker A and Walker B. The all-α subdomain, is much less conserved across AAA proteins. The AAA+ superfamily of ATPases is found in all kingdoms of living organisms where they participate in diverse cellular processes including membrane fusion, proteolysis and DNA replication. Although the terms AAA+ and AAA are often used loosely and interchangeably, the classical AAA family members are distinguished by their possession of the SRH region in the AAA module. Many AAA+ proteins are involved in similar processes to those of AAA proteins (facilitation of protein folding and unfolding, assembly or disassembly of proteins complexes, protein transport and degradation), but others function in replication, recombination, repair and transcription. For a review see.; Dynein heavy chain: Dyneins are described as motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, as they can convert energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to force and move along cytoskeletal polymers, such as microtubules. Dyneins generally contain one to three heavy chains, where each heavy chain consists of a C-terminal globular head, a flexible microtubule-binding stalk, and a flexible N-terminal tail known as the cargo-binding domain. The two categories of dyneins are the axonemal dyneins, which produce the bending motions that propagate along cilia and flagella, and the cytosolic dyneins, which drive a variety of fundamental cellular processes including nuclear migration, organisation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome separation during mitosis, and the positioning and function of many intracellular organelles. Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains.; Dynein heavy chain 3, AAA+ lid domain: This domain represents the AAA lid domain from dynein heavy chain 3 and related proteins.; Dynein heavy chain AAA lid domain: This family represents the AAA lid domain found near the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain AAA lid domain superfamily: Dyneins can be divided into two groups: cytoplasmic dyneins and axonemal dyneins, which are also called ciliary or flagellar dyneins. Dyneins power the beating of cilia and flagella, transport various intracellular cargos and are necessary for mitosis. All dyneins have a 300kDa motor domain consisting of a ring of six AAA domains. ATP hydrolysis in the AAA ring drives the cyclic relocation of a motile element, the linker domain, to generate the force necessary for movement. The cytoplasmic dynein is composed of two identical heavy chains (each >500kDa) and a number of smaller chains. The dynein heavy chain, which belongs to the AAA superfamily of mechanochemical enzymes, is responsible for the motor activities of dynein. The heavy-chain folds into a ring-like head composed of six AAA domains, a stem, and a stalk emerging from the head. The stalk is the microtubule-binding domain with a long coiled-coil structure. The 380kDa recombinant fragment of the C-terminal two-thirds of the Dictyostelium dynein heavy chain maintains microtubule (MT)-activated ATPase activity and drives robust MT sliding, showing that this fragment is the motor domain of the Dictyostelium dynein. This superfamily represents the AAA lid domain found near the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain region D6 P-loop domain: This entry represents the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain. The chain also contains ATPase activity and microtubule binding ability and acts as a motor for the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules. Dynein is also involved in cilia and flagella movement. The dynein subunit consists of at least two heavy chains and a number of intermediate and light chains. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This C-terminal domain carries the D6 region of the dynein motor where the P-loop has been lost in evolution but the general structure of a potential ATP binding site appears to be retained.; Dynein heavy chain, AAA module D4: The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four (D1 - D4) correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two (D5, D6) are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This particular entry represents the D4 ATP-binding domain of the motor.; Dynein heavy chain, ATP-binding dynein motor region: Dyneins are multiprotein complexes that move cargo along microtubules in the minus end direction. The largest component of the dynein complex is the heavy chain. Its C terminus forms the motor unit. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This is the fifth AAA+ domain subdomain AAA5S. Structural analysis reveal that it is the coiled-coil buttress interface. The relative movement of AAA5S together with the stalk (AAA4S), is coupled to rearrangements in the AAA+ ring. Closure of the AAA1 site and the rigid body movement of AAA2-AAA4 force the AAA4/AAA5 interface to close and the AAA6L subdomain to rotate towards the ring centre. The AAA5S subdomain rotates as a unit together with AAA6L, and this movement pulls the buttress relative to the stalk.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain: This family represents the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain. This domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domain.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain, barrel region: Dyneins are microtubule-based AAA motor complexes that power ciliary beating, cell division, cell migration and intracellular transport. The motor domain comprises the AAA ring and three additional structural units: the linker, stalk/strut (both of which are major functional units of the heavy chain) and C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domains. This entry represents the barrel region of the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain, coiled coil stalk: The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules (D1-6), of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This domain occurs between D4 and D5 and includes the two predicted α-helical coiled coil segments that form the stalk supporting the ATP-sensitive microtubule binding component.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in KMT2A; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Bromodomain: Bromodomains are found in a variety of mammalian, invertebrate and yeast DNA-binding proteins. Bromodomains are highly conserved α-helical motifs that can specifically interact with acetylated lysine residues on histone tails. In some proteins, the classical bromodomain has diverged to such an extent that parts of the region are either missing or contain an insertion (e.g., mammalian protein HRX, Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK783.4, yeast protein YTA7). The bromodomain may occur as a single copy, or in duplicate. This domain is present in proteins involved in a wide range of functions such as acetylating histones, remodelling chromatin, and recruiting other factors necessary for transcription, thus playing a critical role in the regulation of transcription.; Extended PHD (ePHD) domain: The extended plant homeodomain (ePHD) domain contains an N-terminal pre-PHD (C2HC zinc finger), a long linker, and a noncanonical PHD finger (C4HC3 zinc finger). The ePHD domain can bind dsDNA but not histones. The pre-PHD-type C2HC zinc finger and the PHD finger in the ePHD domain are associated with each other via extensive hydrophobic interactions and numerous hydrogen bonding interactions and folded as an intact structural module. The pre-PHD-type C2HC zinc finger consists of two α-helices separated by an anti-parallel β-sheet. Three cysteine residues and one histidine residue from the N-terminal loop, β2-strand, and α2-helix coordinate one zinc ion (designated Zn1). The C-terminal part of the ePHD domain is a PHD finger, consisting of one short antiparallel β-sheet and one long antiparallel β-sheet that are linked by one α-helix. Like other PHD fingers, the PHD finger of the ePHD domain consists of two interleaved zinc fingers. A pair of bound zinc ions (designated Zn2 and Zn3) specifically stabilizes the characteristic cross-braced folding topology of the PHD finger. Each zinc ion is coordinated by a combination of four cysteine and histidine residues in which the Zn3 ion is coordinated by a C3H motif instead of a C4 motif. Some proteins known to contain a ePHD domain are listed below:; FY-rich, N-terminal: The \"FY-rich\" domain N-terminal (FYRN) and \"FY-rich\" domain C-terminal (FYRC) sequence motifs are two poorly characterised phenylalanine/ tyrosine-rich regions of around 50 and 100 amino acids, respectively, that are found in a variety of chromatin-associated proteins. They are particularly common in histone H3K4 methyltransferases most notably in a family of proteins that includes human mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) and the Drosophila melanogaster protein trithorax. Both of these enzymes play a key role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression during development, and the gene coding for MLL is frequently rearranged in infant and secondary therapy-related acute leukemias. They are also found in transforming growth factor beta regulator 1 (TBRG1), a growth inhibitory protein induced in cells undergoing arrest in response to DNA damage and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. As TBRG1 has been shown to bind to both the tumor suppressor p14ARF and MDM2, a key regulator of p53, it is also known as nuclear interactor of ARF and MDM2 (NIAM). In most proteins, the FYRN and FYRC regions are closely juxtaposed, however, in MLL and its homologues they are far distant. To be fully active, MLL must be proteolytically processed by taspase1, which cleaves the protein between the FYRN and FYRC regions. The N-terminal and C-terminal fragments remain associated after proteolysis apparently as a result of an interaction between the FYRN and FYRC regions. How proteolytic processing regulates the activity of MLL is not known. Intriguingly, the FYRN and FYRC motifs of a second family of histone H3K4 methyltransferases, represented by MLL2 and MLL4 in humans and TRR in Drosophila melanogaster, are closely juxtaposed. FYRN and FYRC motifs are found in association with modules that create or recognise histone modifications in proteins from a wide range of eukaryotes, and it is likely that in these proteins they have a conserved role related to some aspect of chromatin biology. The FYRN and FYRC regions are not separate independently folded domains, but are components of a distinct protein module. The FYRN and FYRC motifs both form part of a single folded module (the FYR domain), which adopts an α+β fold consisting of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet followed by four consecutive α-helices. The FYRN region corresponds to β-strands 1-4 and their connecting loops, whereas the FYRC motif maps to β-strand 5, β-strand 6 and helices α1 to α4. Most of the conserved tyrosine and phenylalanine residues, after which these motifs are named are involved in interactions that stabilise the fold. Proteins such as MLL, in which the FYRN and FYRC regions are separated by hundreds of amino acids, are expected to contain FYR domains with a large insertion between two of the strands of the β-sheet (strands 4 and 5).; Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A/2B, SET domain: This entry represents the SET domain of Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A/B (KMT2A/B) and KMT2B. Both act as histone methyltransferases that methylate 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (H3K4me), which represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation. Abnormal expression of KMT2B has been associated with early-onset generalized dystonia. The homologue of KMT2A in Drosophila melanogaster is also named Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase trithorax.; KMT2A, ePHD domain: The extended plant homeodomain (ePHD) zinc finger is characterised as Cys2HisCys5HisCys2His. This entry represents the ePHD finger of Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A), which is a histone methyltransferase that belongs to the MLL subfamily of H3K4-specific histone lysine methyltransferases (KMT2). It regulates chromatin-mediated transcription through the catalysis of methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4), and is frequently rearranged in acute leukaemia. KMT2A functions as the catalytic subunit in the MLL1 complex, which also contains WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L and DPY30 as integral core subunits required for the efficient methylation activity of the complex. The MLL1 complex is highly active and specific for H3K4 methylation. KMT2A contains a CxxC (x for any residue) zinc finger domain, three PHD fingers, a Bromodomain domain, this extended PHD finger, two FY (phenylalanine tyrosine)-rich domains, and a SET (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax) domain.; KMT2A, PHD domain 1: This entry represents the first PHD domain of KMT2A. Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A; ) is the catalytic subunit of the MLL1/MLL complex, mediating methylation of 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (H3K4me), a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation. KMT2A is processed by the threonine endopeptidase taspase, releasing products N320 and C180. KMT2A contains a CxxC (x for any residue) zinc finger domain, three plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers, a Bromodomain domain, an extended PHD (ePHD) finger, Cys2HisCys5HisCys2His, two FY (phenylalanine tyrosine)-rich domains, and a SET (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax) domain.; KMT2A, PHD domain 2: This entry represents the second PHD domain of KMT2A. Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A; ) is the catalytic subunit of the MLL1/MLL complex, mediating methylation of 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (H3K4me), a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation. KMT2A is processed by the threonine endopeptidase taspase, releasing products N320 and C180. KMT2A contains a CxxC (x for any residue) zinc finger domain, three plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers, a Bromodomain domain, an extended PHD (ePHD) finger, Cys2HisCys5HisCys2His, two FY (phenylalanine tyrosine)-rich domains, and a SET (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax) domain.; KMT2A, PHD domain 3: Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A; ) is the catalytic subunit of the MLL1/MLL complex, mediating methylation of 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (H3K4me), a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation. KMT2A is processed by the threonine endopeptidase taspase, releasing products N320 and C180. KMT2A contains a CxxC (x for any residue) zinc finger domain, three plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers, a Bromodomain domain, an extended PHD (ePHD) finger, Cys2HisCys5HisCys2His, two FY (phenylalanine tyrosine)-rich domains, and a SET (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax) domain. This entry represents the third PHD domain of KMT2A.; Methyltransferase, trithorax: This entry includes a group of histone methyltransferases. The enzyme activity has been mapped to the SET domain, originally identified in Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly) Su(var)3-9, E(z) and Trithorax proteins. The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene encodes a very large nuclear protein homologous to Drosophila trithorax (Trx). MLL is required for the proper maintenance of HOX gene expression during development and hematopoiesis. The Trithorax group of proteins has been implicated in a variety of processes, including centromeric and telomeric silencing and cell-cycle regulation.; Post-SET domain: This region is found in a number of histone lysine methyltransferases (HMTase), C-terminal to the SET domain; it is generally described as the post-SET domain. Histone lysine methylation is part of the histone code that regulated chromatin function and epigenetic control of gene function. Histone lysine methyltransferases (HMTase) differ both in their substrate specificity for the various acceptor lysines as well as in their product specificity for the number of methyl groups (one, two, or three) they transfer. With just one exception, the HMTases belong to SET family that can be classified according to the sequences surrounding the SET domain. Structural studies on the human SET7/9, a mono-methylase, have revealed the molecular basis for the specificity of the enzyme for the histone-target and the roles of the invariant residues in the SET domain in determining the methylation specificities.; SET domain: The SET domain is a 130 to 140 amino acid, evolutionary well conserved sequence motif that was initially characterised in the Drosophila proteins Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste and Trithorax. In addition to these chromosomal proteins modulating gene activities and/or chromatin structure, the SET domain is found in proteins of diverse functions ranging from yeast to mammals, but also including some bacteria and viruses. The SET domains of mammalian SUV39H1 and 2 and fission yeast clr4 have been shown to be necessary for the methylation of lysine-9 in the histone H3 N terminus. However, this histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity is probably restricted to a subset of SET domain proteins as it requires the combination of the SET domain with the adjacent cysteine-rich regions, one located N-terminally (pre-SET) and the other posterior to the SET domain (post-SET). Post- and pre- SET regions seem then to play a crucial role when it comes to substrate recognition and enzymatic activity. The structure of the SET domain and the two adjacent regions pre-SET and post-SET have been solved. The SET structure is all beta, but consists only in sets of few short strands composing no more than a couple of small sheets. Consequently the SET structure is mostly defined by turns and loops. An unusual feature is that the SET core is made up of two discontinual segments of the primary sequence forming an approximate L shape. Two of the most conserved motifs in the SET domain are constituted by (1) a stretch at the C-terminal containing a strictly conserved tyrosine residue and (2) a preceding loop inside which the C-terminal segment passes forming a knot-like structure, but not quite a true knot. These two regions have been proven to be essential for SAM binding and catalysis, particularly the invariant tyrosine where in all likelihood catalysis takes place.; SET domain superfamily: The SET domain is a 130 to 140 amino acid, evolutionary well conserved sequence motif that was initially characterised in the Drosophila proteins Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste and Trithorax. In eukaryotic organisms, it appears in proteins with an important role in regulating chromatin-mediated gene transcriptional activation and silencing. In viruses,bacteria and archaea, its function is not clear yet. This superfamily includes eukaryotic proteins with histone methyltransferase activity, which requires the combination of the SET domain with the adjacent cysteine-rich regions, one located N-terminally (pre-SET) and the other posterior to the SET domain (post-SET). Post- and pre- SET regions seem then to play a crucial role when it comes to substrate recognition and enzymatic activity. Other SET domain-containing proteins function as transcription factors (such as PR domain zinc finger protein 1 from humans). The structure of the SET domain and the two adjacent regions pre-SET and post-SET have been solved. The SET domain structure is all-β, but consists only in sets of few short strands composing no more than a couple of small sheets. Consequently the SET structure is mostly defined by turns and loops. An unusual feature is that the SET core is made up of two discontinuous segments of the primary sequence forming an approximate L-shape. Two of the most conserved motifs in the SET domain are constituted by a stretch at the C-terminal containing a strictly conserved tyrosine residue and a preceding loop inside which the C-terminal segment passes forming a knot-like structure, but not quite a true knot. These two regions have been proven to be essential for SAM binding and catalysis, particularly the invariant tyrosine where in all likelihood catalysis takes place.; Zinc finger, CXXC-type: Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs which contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates. Their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and of the linker between fingers, as well as on the higher-order structures and the number of fingers. Znf domains are often found in clusters, where fingers can have different binding specificities. There are many superfamilies of Znf motifs, varying in both sequence and structure. They display considerable versatility in binding modes, even between members of the same class (e.g. some bind DNA, others protein), suggesting that Znf motifs are stable scaffolds that have evolved specialised functions. For example, Znf-containing proteins function in gene transcription, translation, mRNA trafficking, cytoskeleton organisation, epithelial development, cell adhesion, protein folding, chromatin remodelling and zinc sensing, to name but a few. Zinc-binding motifs are stable structures, and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target. This domain contains eight conserved cysteine residues that bind to two zinc ions. The CXXC domain is found in a variety of chromatin-associated proteins. This domain binds to non-methylated CpG dinucleotides. The domain is characterised by two CGXCXXC repeats. The RecQ helicase has a single repeat that also binds to zinc, but this has not been included in this family. The DNA binding interface has been identified by NMR.; Zinc finger, FYVE/PHD-type: The FYVE zinc finger domain is conserved from yeast to man, and is named after four proteins that it has been found in: Fab1, YOTB/ZK632.12, Vac1, and EEA1. It functions in the membrane recruitment of cytosolic proteins by binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), which is found mainly on endosomes. The plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger domain has a C4HC3-type motif, and is widely distributed in eukaryotes, being found in many chromatin regulatory factors. Both the FYVE and the PHD zinc finger motifs display strikingly similar dimetal(zinc)-bound α+β folds. Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs which contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates.

Zinc-binding motifs are stable structures, and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target.; Zinc finger, PHD-type: This entry represents the PHD (homeodomain) zinc finger domain, which is a C4HC3 zinc-finger-like motif found in nuclear proteins thought to be involved in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation. The PHD finger motif is reminiscent of, but distinct from the C3HC4 type RING finger. The function of this domain is not yet known but in analogy with the LIM domain it could be involved in protein-protein interaction and be important for the assembly or activity of multicomponent complexes involved in transcriptional activation or repression. Alternatively, the interactions could be intra-molecular and be important in maintaining the structural integrity of the protein. In similarity to the RING finger and the LIM domain, the PHD finger is thought to bind two zinc ions. Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs which contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates. Their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and of the linker between fingers, as well as on the higher-order structures and the number of fingers. Znf domains are often found in clusters, where fingers can have different binding specificities. There are many superfamilies of Znf motifs, varying in both sequence and structure. They display considerable versatility in binding modes, even between members of the same class (e.g. some bind DNA, others protein), suggesting that Znf motifs are stable scaffolds that have evolved specialised functions. For example, Znf-containing proteins function in gene transcription, translation, mRNA trafficking, cytoskeleton organisation, epithelial development, cell adhesion, protein folding, chromatin remodelling and zinc sensing, to name but a few. Zinc-binding motifs are stable structures, and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target.; Zinc finger, RING/FYVE/PHD-type: This superfamily represents RING-, PHD-, and FYVE-type zinc finger domains, which share a common dimetal (zinc)-bound α/β structural fold, as well as the non-zinc-containing U-box domain, which is similar to the RING zinc finger only lacking the metal ion-binding residues (U-box associated with multi-ubiquitination).

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in DYNC2H1; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic; Phenotypes: Jeune thoracic dystrophy; Asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy 3; AAA+ ATPase domain: This entry represents the AAA+ ATPase domain found in a range of proteins, including Holliday junction ATP-dependent DNA helicase RuvB from Mycobacterium sp, ATP synthases, and related ATP-dependent proteins. The proteins in this superfamily are characterised by the structural conservation of a central ATPase domain of about 250 amino acids called the AAA module. Typically, the AAA domain can be divided into two structural subdomains, an N-terminal P-loop NTPase α-β-α subdomain that is connected to a smaller C-terminal all-α subdomain. The α-β-α subdomain adopts a Rossman fold and contains several motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, including classical motifs Walker A and Walker B. The all-α subdomain, is much less conserved across AAA proteins. The AAA+ superfamily of ATPases is found in all kingdoms of living organisms where they participate in diverse cellular processes including membrane fusion, proteolysis and DNA replication. Although the terms AAA+ and AAA are often used loosely and interchangeably, the classical AAA family members are distinguished by their possession of the SRH region in the AAA module. Many AAA+ proteins are involved in similar processes to those of AAA proteins (facilitation of protein folding and unfolding, assembly or disassembly of proteins complexes, protein transport and degradation), but others function in replication, recombination, repair and transcription. For a review see.; Cytoplasmic dynein 2 heavy chain 1, AAA+ ATPase domain: This domain is found in Cytoplasmic dynein 2 heavy chain 1 from humans (DYNC2H1) and similar sequences mainly found in animals. Dynein-2 is essential for the dynamic remodelling of the ciliary proteome and is associated with human skeletal ciliopathies. DYNC2H1, one of its specific components, is the motor-domain- containing heavy chain. This protein consists of a compact N-terminal region, an elongated tail and a C-terminal AAA motor domain. There are two copies of this protein in the complex, each adopting a different configuration, which contributes to the asymmetry of Dynein-2. This entry covers one of the six motor's ring AAA domains (ATPases associated with various cellular activities).; Dynein 2 heavy chain 1, cytoplasmic, ATPase lid domain: Dyneins are microtubule-based AAA motor complexes that power ciliary beating, cell division, cell migration and intracellular transport and comprise cytoplasmic and axonemal isoforms. They consist of a motor domain that contains a ring-shaped head with six AAA-domains, a coiled-coil stalk with a microtubule binding domain (MTBD) and a linker. This entry represents the lid domain found at the C-terminal of the third AAA+ ATPase domain in human Cytoplasmic dynein 2 heavy chain 1 (DYNC2H1) and similar eukaryotic sequences.; Dynein heavy chain: Dyneins are described as motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, as they can convert energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to force and move along cytoskeletal polymers, such as microtubules. Dyneins generally contain one to three heavy chains, where each heavy chain consists of a C-terminal globular head, a flexible microtubule-binding stalk, and a flexible N-terminal tail known as the cargo-binding domain. The two categories of dyneins are the axonemal dyneins, which produce the bending motions that propagate along cilia and flagella, and the cytosolic dyneins, which drive a variety of fundamental cellular processes including nuclear migration, organisation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome separation during mitosis, and the positioning and function of many intracellular organelles. Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains.; Dynein heavy chain AAA lid domain: This family represents the AAA lid domain found near the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain AAA lid domain superfamily: Dyneins can be divided into two groups: cytoplasmic dyneins and axonemal dyneins, which are also called ciliary or flagellar dyneins. Dyneins power the beating of cilia and flagella, transport various intracellular cargos and are necessary for mitosis. All dyneins have a 300kDa motor domain consisting of a ring of six AAA domains. ATP hydrolysis in the AAA ring drives the cyclic relocation of a motile element, the linker domain, to generate the force necessary for movement. The cytoplasmic dynein is composed of two identical heavy chains (each >500kDa) and a number of smaller chains. The dynein heavy chain, which belongs to the AAA superfamily of mechanochemical enzymes, is responsible for the motor activities of dynein. The heavy-chain folds into a ring-like head composed of six AAA domains, a stem, and a stalk emerging from the head. The stalk is the microtubule-binding domain with a long coiled-coil structure. The 380kDa recombinant fragment of the C-terminal two-thirds of the Dictyostelium dynein heavy chain maintains microtubule (MT)-activated ATPase activity and drives robust MT sliding, showing that this fragment is the motor domain of the Dictyostelium dynein. This superfamily represents the AAA lid domain found near the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain region D6 P-loop domain: This entry represents the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain. The chain also contains ATPase activity and microtubule binding ability and acts as a motor for the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules. Dynein is also involved in cilia and flagella movement. The dynein subunit consists of at least two heavy chains and a number of intermediate and light chains. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This C-terminal domain carries the D6 region of the dynein motor where the P-loop has been lost in evolution but the general structure of a potential ATP binding site appears to be retained.; Dynein heavy chain, AAA module D4: The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four (D1 - D4) correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two (D5, D6) are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This particular entry represents the D4 ATP-binding domain of the motor.; Dynein heavy chain, AAA1 domain, small subdomain: Dyneins are multiprotein complexes that move cargo along microtubules in the minus end direction. The largest component of the dynein complex is the heavy chain. Its C terminus forms the motor unit. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This domain is the D1 unit of the motor and contains the hydrolytic ATP binding site. Each AAA domain can be subdivided into a \"large\" (AAAL) and a five helix bundle or \"small\" subdomain (AAAS). AAA1L, AAA1S and AAA2L enclose ADP.vanadate (ADP.Vi, ATP-hydrolysis transition state analogue). The AAA1L sensor-I loop, which varies in position depending on dynein's nucleotide state, swings in to contact AAA2L forming the important AAA1 nucleotide-binding site. This entry represents the small subdomain of the AAA1 domain.; Dynein heavy chain, ATP-binding dynein motor region: Dyneins are multiprotein complexes that move cargo along microtubules in the minus end direction. The largest component of the dynein complex is the heavy chain. Its C terminus forms the motor unit. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This is the fifth AAA+ domain subdomain AAA5S. Structural analysis reveal that it is the coiled-coil buttress interface. The relative movement of AAA5S together with the stalk (AAA4S), is coupled to rearrangements in the AAA+ ring. Closure of the AAA1 site and the rigid body movement of AAA2-AAA4 force the AAA4/AAA5 interface to close and the AAA6L subdomain to rotate towards the ring centre. The AAA5S subdomain rotates as a unit together with AAA6L, and this movement pulls the buttress relative to the stalk.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain: This family represents the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain. This domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domain.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain, barrel region: Dyneins are microtubule-based AAA motor complexes that power ciliary beating, cell division, cell migration and intracellular transport. The motor domain comprises the AAA ring and three additional structural units: the linker, stalk/strut (both of which are major functional units of the heavy chain) and C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domains. This entry represents the barrel region of the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain, coiled coil stalk: The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules (D1-6), of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This domain occurs between D4 and D5 and includes the two predicted α-helical coiled coil segments that form the stalk supporting the ATP-sensitive microtubule binding component.; Dynein heavy chain, domain 2, N-terminal: Dyneins are described as motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, as they can convert energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to force and movement along cytoskeletal polymers, such as microtubules. Dyneins generally contain one to three heavy chains, which belong to the AAA+ superfamily of mechanochemical enzymes. Each heavy chain consists of a flexible N-terminal tail known as the cargo-binding domain and a motor domain which consists of an ATP-hydrolysing AAA+ ring, a flexible microtubule-binding stalk, a linker and a C-sequence. The stalk has an ATP-sensitive microtubule-binding site (MTBD) at its tip, whereas the linker has been suggested to function as a mechanical element for generating dynein's power stroke. The two categories of dyneins are the axonemal dyneins, which produce the bending motions that propagate along cilia and flagella, and the cytosolic dyneins, which drive a variety of fundamental cellular processes including nuclear migration, organisation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome separation during mitosis, and the positioning and function of many intracellular organelles. Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains. This superfamily represents the N-terminal part of the second domain of dynein heavy chain. No function seems to have been attributed specifically to this region.; Dynein heavy chain, hydrolytic ATP-binding dynein motor region: Dyneins are multiprotein complexes that move cargo along microtubules in the minus end direction. The largest component of the dynein complex is the heavy chain. Its C terminus forms the motor unit. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This domain is the D1 unit of the motor and contains the hydrolytic ATP binding site. This is the AAA1 large (AAA1L) subdomain with the accompanying small subdomain (AAA1S). AAA1L, AAA1S and AAA2L enclose ADP.vanadate (ADP.Vi, ATP-hydrolysis transition state analogue). The AAA1L sensor-I loop, which varies in position depending on dynein's nucleotide state, swings in to contact AAA2L forming the important AAA1 nucleotide-binding site.; Dynein heavy chain, linker: Dyneins are described as motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, as they can convert energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to force and movement along cytoskeletal polymers, such as microtubules. Dyneins generally contain one to three heavy chains, which belong to the AAA+ superfamily of mechanochemical enzymes. Each heavy chain consists of a flexible N-terminal tail known as the cargo-binding domain and a motor domain which consists of an ATP-hydrolysing AAA+ ring, a flexible microtubule-binding stalk, a linker and a C-sequence. The stalk has an ATP-sensitive microtubule-binding site (MTBD) at its tip, whereas the linker has been suggested to function as a mechanical element for generating dynein's power stroke. The two categories of dyneins are the axonemal dyneins, which produce the bending motions that propagate along cilia and flagella, and the cytosolic dyneins, which drive a variety of fundamental cellular processes including nuclear migration, organisation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome separation during mitosis, and the positioning and function of many intracellular organelles. Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains. This entry represents the linker of the dynein heavy chain motor domain.; Dynein heavy chain, linker, subdomain 3: Dyneins are described as motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, as they can convert energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to force and movement along cytoskeletal polymers, such as microtubules. Dyneins generally contain one to three heavy chains, which belong to the AAA+ superfamily of mechanochemical enzymes. Each heavy chain consists of a flexible N-terminal tail known as the cargo-binding domain and a motor domain which consists of an ATP-hydrolysing AAA+ ring, a flexible microtubule-binding stalk, a linker and a C-sequence. The stalk has an ATP-sensitive microtubule-binding site (MTBD) at its tip, whereas the linker has been suggested to function as a mechanical element for generating dynein's power stroke.

Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains. This superfamily represents the subdomain 3 found in the linker domain of dynein heavy chain. The linker exists as a rod-like structure that comprises nineteen α-helices and eight β-strands and can be divided into five subdomains from 0 to 4. This subdomain interacts with subdomain 2 and 4 and has been suggested to play a role in the interactions between the linker base and the ring.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.",

Dyneins generally contain one to three heavy chains, where each heavy chain consists of a C-terminal globular head, a flexible microtubule-binding stalk, and a flexible N-terminal tail known as the cargo-binding domain. The two categories of dyneins are the axonemal dyneins, which produce the bending motions that propagate along cilia and flagella, and the cytosolic dyneins, which drive a variety of fundamental cellular processes including nuclear migration, organisation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome separation during mitosis, and the positioning and function of many intracellular organelles. Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain: This family represents the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain. This domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domain.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain, barrel region: Dyneins are microtubule-based AAA motor complexes that power ciliary beating, cell division, cell migration and intracellular transport. The motor domain comprises the AAA ring and three additional structural units: the linker, stalk/strut (both of which are major functional units of the heavy chain) and C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domains. This entry represents the barrel region of the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in EP300; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to EP300 haploinsufficiency; CBP/p300-type histone acetyltransferase domain: Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes play important roles in the regulation of chromatin assembly, RNA transcription, DNA repair and other DNA-templated reactions through the lysine side-chain acetylation of histones and other transcription factors. HATs fall into at least four different families based on sequence conservation within the HAT domain. This includes Gcn5/PCAF, CBP/p300, Rtt109 and MYST families. The different HAT families contain a structurally conserved central region associated with acetyl-Coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) cofactor binding but distinct catalytic mechanisms and structurally divergent flanking regions that mediate different chromatin regulatory functions. Protein acetylation extends beyond histones to other nuclear proteins and even cytoplasmic proteins to regulate diverse biological processes including the regulation of cell cycle, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeleton reorganisation and metabolism. CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 proteins are involved in various physiological events including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. CBP/p300 proteins contain several well-defined protein-interaction domains as well as a centrally located 380-residue HAT domain. The overall fold of the CBP/p300-type HAT domain consists of a central β-sheet comprising seven β-strands surrounded by nine α-helices and several loops. Some proteins known to contain a cBP/p300-type HAT domain are listed below:; Histone acetyltransferase Rtt109/CBP: Histone acetylation is required in many cellular processes including transcription, DNA repair, and chromatin assembly. This family contains the fungal RTT109 protein, which is required for H3K56 acetylation. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Fission yeast) loss of RTT109 results in the loss of H3K56 acetylation, both on bulk histone and on chromatin. RTT109 and H3K56 acetylation appear to correlate with actively transcribed genes and associate with the elongating form of Pol II in yeast. This family also includes p300/CBP acetyltransferase, which has different catalytic properties and cofactor regulation to RTT109. CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a transcriptional co-activator that acetylates both histones and non-histone proteins. CBP binds specifically to phosphorylated CREB and enhances its transcriptional activity toward cAMP-responsive genes.; Nuclear receptor coactivator, CREB-bp-like, interlocking: This entry represents the interlocking domain of the eukaryotic nuclear receptor coactivators CREBP and p300. The interlocking domain forms a 3-helical non-globular array that forms interlocked heterodimers with its target. Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors involved in the regulation of many processes, including development, reproduction and homeostasis. Nuclear receptor coactivators act to modulate the function of nuclear receptors. Coactivators associate with promoters and enhancers primarily through protein-protein contacts to facilitate the interaction between DNA-bound transcription factors and the transcription machinery. Many of these coactivators are structurally related, including CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300. CBP and p300 both have histone acetyltransferase activity. CBP/p300 proteins function synergistically to activate transcription, acting to remodel chromatin and to recruit RNA polymerase II and the basal transcription machinery. CBP is required for proper cell cycle control, differentiation and apoptosis. The interaction of CBP/p300 with transcription factors involves several small domains. The IBiD domain in the C-terminal of CBP is responsible for CBP interaction with IRF-3, as well as with the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A, TIF-2 coactivator, and the IRF homologue KSHV IRF-1.; Nuclear receptor coactivator, CREB-bp-like, interlocking domain superfamily: This entry represents the interlocking domain superfamily of the eukaryotic nuclear receptor coactivators CREBP and p300. The interlocking domain forms a 3-helical non-globular array that forms interlocked heterodimers with its target. Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors involved in the regulation of many processes, including development, reproduction and homeostasis.

The interlocking domain forms a 3-helical non-globular array that forms interlocked heterodimers with its target. Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors involved in the regulation of many processes, including development, reproduction and homeostasis. Nuclear receptor coactivators act to modulate the function of nuclear receptors. Coactivators associate with promoters and enhancers primarily through protein-protein contacts to facilitate the interaction between DNA-bound transcription factors and the transcription machinery. Many of these coactivators are structurally related, including CBP (CREB-binding protein), P300 and ACTR (activator for thyroid and retinoid receptors). CBP and P300 both have histone acetyltransferase activity. CBP/P300 proteins function synergistically to activate transcription, acting to remodel chromatin and to recruit RNA polymerase II and the basal transcription machinery. CBP is required for proper cell cycle control, differentiation and apoptosis. The interaction of CBP/P300 with transcription factors involves several small domains. The IBiD domain in the C-terminal of CBP is responsible for CBP interaction with IRF-3, as well as with the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A, TIF-2 coactivator, and the IRF homologue KSHV IRF-1. Ncoa1, Ncoa2 and Ncoa3 are all coactivators of various nuclear receptors. In addition, Ncoa1 and Ncoa3 both have histone acetyltransferase activity, but Ncoa2 does not.; TAZ domain superfamily: TAZ (Transcription Adaptor putative Zinc finger) domains are zinc-containing domains found in the homologous transcriptional co-activators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and the P300. CBP and P300 are histone acetyltransferases that catalyse the reversible acetylation of all four histones in nucleosomes, acting to regulate transcription via chromatin remodelling. These large nuclear proteins interact with numerous transcription factors and viral oncoproteins, including p53 tumour suppressor protein, E1A oncoprotein, MyoD, and GATA-1, and are involved in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Both CBP and P300 have two copies of the TAZ domain, one in the N-terminal region, the other in the C-terminal region. The TAZ1 domain of CBP and P300 forms a complex with CITED2 (CBP/P300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail), inhibiting the activity of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1alpha) and thereby attenuating the cellular response to low tissue oxygen concentration. Adaptation to hypoxia is mediated by transactivation of hypoxia-responsive genes by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in complex with the CBP and p300 transcriptional coactivators. Proteins containing this domain also include a group of land-plant specific proteins, know as the BTB/POZ and TAZ domain-containing (BT) protein. The reports of their interaction with CUL3 are contradictory. They are multifunctional scaffold proteins essential for male and female gametophyte development.; Zinc finger, TAZ-type: TAZ (Transcription Adaptor putative Zinc finger) domains are zinc-containing domains found in the homologous transcriptional co-activators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and the P300. CBP and P300 are histone acetyltransferases that catalyse the reversible acetylation of all four histones in nucleosomes, acting to regulate transcription via chromatin remodelling. These large nuclear proteins interact with numerous transcription factors and viral oncoproteins, including p53 tumour suppressor protein, E1A oncoprotein, MyoD, and GATA-1, and are involved in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis.

Proteins containing this domain also include a group of land-plant specific proteins, know as the BTB/POZ and TAZ domain-containing (BT) protein. The reports of their interaction with CUL3 are contradictory. They are multifunctional scaffold proteins essential for male and female gametophyte development. Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs which contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates. Their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and of the linker between fingers, as well as on the higher-order structures and the number of fingers. Znf domains are often found in clusters, where fingers can have different binding specificities. There are many superfamilies of Znf motifs, varying in both sequence and structure. They display considerable versatility in binding modes, even between members of the same class (e.g. some bind DNA, others protein), suggesting that Znf motifs are stable scaffolds that have evolved specialised functions. For example, Znf-containing proteins function in gene transcription, translation, mRNA trafficking, cytoskeleton organisation, epithelial development, cell adhesion, protein folding, chromatin remodelling and zinc sensing, to name but a few. Zinc-binding motifs are stable structures, and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target.; Zinc finger, ZZ-type: This entry represents ZZ-type zinc finger domains, named because of their ability to bind two zinc ions. These domains contain 4-6 Cys residues that participate in zinc binding (plus additional Ser/His residues), including a Cys-X2-Cys motif found in other zinc finger domains. These zinc fingers are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. The structure of the ZZ domain shows that it belongs to the family of cross-brace zinc finger motifs that include the PHD, RING, and FYVE domains. ZZ-type zinc finger domains are found in: Single copies of the ZZ zinc finger occur in the transcriptional adaptor/coactivator proteins P300, in cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and ADA2. CBP provides several binding sites for transcriptional coactivators. The site of interaction with the tumour suppressor protein p53 and the oncoprotein E1A with CBP/P300 is a Cys-rich region that incorporates two zinc-binding motifs: ZZ-type and TAZ2-type. The ZZ-type zinc finger of CBP contains two twisted anti-parallel β-sheets and a short α-helix, and binds two zinc ions. One zinc ion is coordinated by four cysteine residues via 2 Cys-X2-Cys motifs, and the third zinc ion via a third Cys-X-Cys motif and a His-X-His motif. The first zinc cluster is strictly conserved, whereas the second zinc cluster displays variability in the position of the two His residues. In Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress), the hypersensitive to red and blue 1 (Hrb1) protein, which regulating both red and blue light responses, contains a ZZ-type zinc finger domain. ZZ-type zinc finger domains have also been identified in the testis-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MEX that promotes death receptor-induced apoptosis. MEX has four putative zinc finger domains: one ZZ-type, one SWIM-type and two RING-type. The region containing the ZZ-type and RING-type zinc fingers is required for interaction with UbcH5a and MEX self-association, whereas the SWIM domain was critical for MEX ubiquitination. In addition, the Cys-rich domains of dystrophin, utrophin and an 87kDa post-synaptic protein contain a ZZ-type zinc finger with high sequence identity to P300/CBP ZZ-type zinc fingers. In dystrophin and utrophin, the ZZ-type zinc finger lies between a WW domain (flanked by and EF hand) and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Dystrophin is thought to act as a link between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, and perturbations of the dystrophin-associated complex, for example, between dystrophin and the transmembrane glycoprotein beta-dystroglycan, may lead to muscular dystrophy. Dystrophin and its autosomal homologue utrophin interact with beta-dystroglycan via their C-terminal regions, which are comprised of a WW domain, an EF hand domain and a ZZ-type zinc finger domain. The WW domain is the primary site of interaction between dystrophin or utrophin and dystroglycan, while the EF hand and ZZ-type zinc finger domains stabilise and strengthen this interaction. Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs which contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates.

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in WRN; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Werner syndrome; ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecQ, zinc-binding domain: This domain is the zinc-binding domain of ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecQ.; DEAD/DEAH-box helicase domain: This entry represents the DNA-binding domain at the N-terminal in DEAD/DEAH box helicase and related proteins. This domain also contains motif III (S-A-T) which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities. DEAD-box and DEAH-box RNA helicases are essential enzymes involved in the unwinding of nucleic acids, playing critical roles in RNA metabolism. The DEAD-box helicases, exemplified by the translation initiation factor eIF4A, are RNA-dependent ATPases that act as RNA helicases in conjunction with eIF4B. These proteins participate in a wide range of processes including nuclear transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, nucleocytoplasmic transport, translation, RNA decay and organellar gene expression. In contrast, DEAH-box helicases are primarily involved in pre-mRNA splicing and function as ATP-dependent RNA helicases.; DNA helicase, ATP-dependent, RecQ type: The ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecQ is involved in genome maintenance. All homologues tested to date unwind paired DNA, translocating in a 3' to 5' direction and several have a preference for forked or 4-way DNA structures (e.g. Holliday junctions) or for G-quartet DNA. The yeast protein, Sgs1, is present in numerous foci that coincide with sites of de novo synthesis DNA, such as the replication fork, and protein levels peak during S-phase. A model has been proposed for Sgs1p action in the S-phase checkpoint response, both as a 'sensor' for damage during replication and a 'resolvase' for structures that arise at paused forks, such as the four-way 'chickenfoot' structure. The action of Sgs1p may serve to maintain the proper amount and integrity of ss DNA that is necessary for the binding of RPA (replication protein A, the eukaryotic ss DNA-binding protein)-DNA pol complexes. Sgs1p would thus function by detecting (or resolving) aberrant DNA structures, and would thus contribute to the full activation of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, Mec1p and the effector kinase, Rad53p. Its ability to bind both the large subunit of RPA and the RecA-like protein Rad51p, place it in a unique position to resolve inappropriate fork structures that can occur when either the leading or lagging strand synthesis is stalled. Thus, RecQ helicases integrate checkpoint activation and checkpoint response.; Helicase Helix-turn-helix domain: This presumed domain is found at the C terminus of a large number of helicases, including human Bifunctional 3'-5' exonuclease/ATP-dependent helicase WRN, a multifunctional enzyme that has magnesium and ATP-dependent 3'-5' DNA-helicase activity on partially duplex substrates and also has 3'->5' exonuclease activity towards double-stranded (ds)DNA with a 5'-overhang. Its depletion leads to chromosomal breaks and genome instability.; Helicase superfamily 1/2, ATP-binding domain: This entry represents the DNA-binding domain of classical SF1 and SF2 helicases. It does not recognise bacterial DinG and eukaryotic Rad3 which differ from other SF1-SF2 helicases by the presence of a large insert after the Walker A (see ). Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). All of the proteins bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A (phosphate-binding loop or P-loop) and Walker B (Mg2+-binding aspartic acid) motifs. For the two largest groups, commonly referred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been identified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses that seem to be active as monomers or dimers. RNA and DNA helicases are considered to be enzymes that catalyse the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in an energy-dependent manner. The various structures of SF1 and SF2 helicases present a common core with two α-β RecA-like domains. The structural homology with the RecA recombination protein covers the five contiguous parallel β-strands and the tandem α-helices. ATP binds to the amino proximal α-β domain, where the Walker A (motif I) and Walker B (motif II) are found. The N-terminal domain also contains motif III (S-A-T) which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities. The carboxy-terminal α-β domain is structurally very similar to the proximal one even though it is bereft of an ATP-binding site, suggesting that it may have originally arisen through gene duplication of the first one. Some members of helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 are listed below:; Helicase, C-terminal domain-like: Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). For the two largest groups, commonly referred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been identified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses. This entry represents the C-terminal domain found in proteins belonging to the helicase superfamilies 1 and 2. Included in this group is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), a member of the DEA(D/H)-box RNA helicase family. The structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of eIF4A has been determined; it has a parallel α-β topology that superimposes, with minor variations, on the structures and conserved motifs of the equivalent domain in other, distantly related helicases.; HRDC domain: The HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain is comprised of two orthogonally packed α-hairpin subdomains, and is involved in interactions with DNA and protein. It has been suggested that this domain plays a role dissolving double Holliday junctions efficiently. HRDC domains are found at the C terminus of many RecQ helicases, including the human Bifunctional 3'-5' exonuclease/ATP-dependent helicase WRN and RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM. RecQ helicases have been shown to unwind DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. The structure of the HRDC domain consists of a 4-5 helical bundle of two orthogonally packed α-hairpins, and as such it resembles auxiliary domains in bacterial DNA helicases and other proteins that interact with nucleic acids. A positively charged region on the surface of the HRDC domain is able to interact with DNA. The HRDC domain is also present in eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerase II subunit RBP4, the N-terminal of which forms a heterodimerisation α-hairpin. The HRDC domain has a putative role in nucleic acid binding. Mutations in the HRDC domain associated with the human BLM gene result in Bloom Syndrome (BS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by proportionate pre- and postnatal growth deficiency; sun-sensitive, telangiectatic, hypo- and hyperpigmented skin; predisposition to malignancy; and chromosomal instability.; HRDC-like superfamily: This superfamily represents the HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain, which comprises two orthogonally packed α-hairpin subdomains, and is involved in interactions with DNA and protein. The HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain is found at the C terminus of many RecQ helicases, including the human Bifunctional 3'-5' exonuclease/ATP-dependent helicase WRN and RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM (previously known as Werner and Bloom syndrome proteins). RecQ helicases have been shown to unwind DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. The structure of the HRDC domain consists of a 4-5 helical bundle of two orthogonally packed α-hairpins, and as such it resembles auxiliary domains in bacterial DNA helicases and other proteins that interact with nucleic acids. A positively charged region on the surface of the HRDC domain is able to interact with DNA. The HRDC domain is also present in eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerase II subunit RBP4, the N-terminal of which forms a heterodimerisation α-hairpin.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.; RQC domain: This entry represents the RQC domain, which is a DNA-binding domain found only in RecQ family enzymes. RecQ family helicases can unwind G4 DNA, and play important roles at G-rich domains of the genome, including the telomeres, rDNA, and immunoglobulin switch regions. This domain has a helix-turn-helix structure and acts as a high affinity G4 DNA binding domain. Binding of RecQ to Holliday junctions involves both the RQC and the HRDC domains.; Winged helix DNA-binding domain superfamily: Winged helix DNA-binding proteins share a related winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, where the \"wings\", or loops, are small β-sheets. The winged helix motif consists of two wings (W1, W2), three α-helices (H1, H2, H3) and three β-sheets (S1, S2, S3) arranged in the order H1-S1-H2-H3-S2-W1-S3-W2. The DNA-recognition helix makes sequence-specific DNA contacts with the major groove of DNA, while the wings make different DNA contacts, often with the minor groove or the backbone of DNA. Several winged-helix proteins display an exposed patch of hydrophobic residues thought to mediate protein-protein interactions.; Winged helix-like DNA-binding domain superfamily: Winged helix DNA-binding proteins share a related winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, where the \"wings\", or loops, are small β-sheets.

The DNA-recognition helix makes sequence-specific DNA contacts with the major groove of DNA, while the wings make different DNA contacts, often with the minor groove or the backbone of DNA. Several winged-helix proteins display an exposed patch of hydrophobic residues thought to mediate protein-protein interactions. Many different proteins with diverse biological functions contain a winged helix DNA-binding domain, including transcriptional repressors such as biotin repressor, LexA repressor and the arginine repressor; transcription factors such as the hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 proteins involved in cell differentiation, heat-shock transcription factor, and the general transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIF; helicases such as RuvB that promotes branch migration at the Holliday junction, and CDC6 in the pre-replication complex; endonucleases such as FokI and TnsA; histones; and Mu transposase, where the flexible wing of the enhancer-binding domain is essential for efficient transposition.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in DNAH11; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Primary ciliary dyskinesia; Dynein heavy chain: Dyneins are described as motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, as they can convert energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to force and move along cytoskeletal polymers, such as microtubules. Dyneins generally contain one to three heavy chains, where each heavy chain consists of a C-terminal globular head, a flexible microtubule-binding stalk, and a flexible N-terminal tail known as the cargo-binding domain. The two categories of dyneins are the axonemal dyneins, which produce the bending motions that propagate along cilia and flagella, and the cytosolic dyneins, which drive a variety of fundamental cellular processes including nuclear migration, organisation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome separation during mitosis, and the positioning and function of many intracellular organelles. Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains.; Dynein heavy chain AAA lid domain: This family represents the AAA lid domain found near the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain AAA lid domain superfamily: Dyneins can be divided into two groups: cytoplasmic dyneins and axonemal dyneins, which are also called ciliary or flagellar dyneins. Dyneins power the beating of cilia and flagella, transport various intracellular cargos and are necessary for mitosis. All dyneins have a 300kDa motor domain consisting of a ring of six AAA domains. ATP hydrolysis in the AAA ring drives the cyclic relocation of a motile element, the linker domain, to generate the force necessary for movement. The cytoplasmic dynein is composed of two identical heavy chains (each >500kDa) and a number of smaller chains. The dynein heavy chain, which belongs to the AAA superfamily of mechanochemical enzymes, is responsible for the motor activities of dynein. The heavy-chain folds into a ring-like head composed of six AAA domains, a stem, and a stalk emerging from the head. The stalk is the microtubule-binding domain with a long coiled-coil structure. The 380kDa recombinant fragment of the C-terminal two-thirds of the Dictyostelium dynein heavy chain maintains microtubule (MT)-activated ATPase activity and drives robust MT sliding, showing that this fragment is the motor domain of the Dictyostelium dynein. This superfamily represents the AAA lid domain found near the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain region D6 P-loop domain: This entry represents the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain. The chain also contains ATPase activity and microtubule binding ability and acts as a motor for the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules. Dynein is also involved in cilia and flagella movement. The dynein subunit consists of at least two heavy chains and a number of intermediate and light chains. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This C-terminal domain carries the D6 region of the dynein motor where the P-loop has been lost in evolution but the general structure of a potential ATP binding site appears to be retained.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain: This family represents the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain. This domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domain.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain, barrel region: Dyneins are microtubule-based AAA motor complexes that power ciliary beating, cell division, cell migration and intracellular transport. The motor domain comprises the AAA ring and three additional structural units: the linker, stalk/strut (both of which are major functional units of the heavy chain) and C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domains. This entry represents the barrel region of the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in DNAH11; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Primary ciliary dyskinesia; AAA+ ATPase domain: This entry represents the AAA+ ATPase domain found in a range of proteins, including Holliday junction ATP-dependent DNA helicase RuvB from Mycobacterium sp, ATP synthases, and related ATP-dependent proteins. The proteins in this superfamily are characterised by the structural conservation of a central ATPase domain of about 250 amino acids called the AAA module. Typically, the AAA domain can be divided into two structural subdomains, an N-terminal P-loop NTPase α-β-α subdomain that is connected to a smaller C-terminal all-α subdomain. The α-β-α subdomain adopts a Rossman fold and contains several motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, including classical motifs Walker A and Walker B. The all-α subdomain, is much less conserved across AAA proteins. The AAA+ superfamily of ATPases is found in all kingdoms of living organisms where they participate in diverse cellular processes including membrane fusion, proteolysis and DNA replication. Although the terms AAA+ and AAA are often used loosely and interchangeably, the classical AAA family members are distinguished by their possession of the SRH region in the AAA module. Many AAA+ proteins are involved in similar processes to those of AAA proteins (facilitation of protein folding and unfolding, assembly or disassembly of proteins complexes, protein transport and degradation), but others function in replication, recombination, repair and transcription. For a review see.; Dynein heavy chain: Dyneins are described as motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, as they can convert energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to force and move along cytoskeletal polymers, such as microtubules. Dyneins generally contain one to three heavy chains, where each heavy chain consists of a C-terminal globular head, a flexible microtubule-binding stalk, and a flexible N-terminal tail known as the cargo-binding domain. The two categories of dyneins are the axonemal dyneins, which produce the bending motions that propagate along cilia and flagella, and the cytosolic dyneins, which drive a variety of fundamental cellular processes including nuclear migration, organisation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome separation during mitosis, and the positioning and function of many intracellular organelles. Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains.; Dynein heavy chain AAA lid domain: This family represents the AAA lid domain found near the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain AAA lid domain superfamily: Dyneins can be divided into two groups: cytoplasmic dyneins and axonemal dyneins, which are also called ciliary or flagellar dyneins. Dyneins power the beating of cilia and flagella, transport various intracellular cargos and are necessary for mitosis. All dyneins have a 300kDa motor domain consisting of a ring of six AAA domains. ATP hydrolysis in the AAA ring drives the cyclic relocation of a motile element, the linker domain, to generate the force necessary for movement. The cytoplasmic dynein is composed of two identical heavy chains (each >500kDa) and a number of smaller chains. The dynein heavy chain, which belongs to the AAA superfamily of mechanochemical enzymes, is responsible for the motor activities of dynein. The heavy-chain folds into a ring-like head composed of six AAA domains, a stem, and a stalk emerging from the head. The stalk is the microtubule-binding domain with a long coiled-coil structure. The 380kDa recombinant fragment of the C-terminal two-thirds of the Dictyostelium dynein heavy chain maintains microtubule (MT)-activated ATPase activity and drives robust MT sliding, showing that this fragment is the motor domain of the Dictyostelium dynein. This superfamily represents the AAA lid domain found near the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain region D6 P-loop domain: This entry represents the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain. The chain also contains ATPase activity and microtubule binding ability and acts as a motor for the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules. Dynein is also involved in cilia and flagella movement. The dynein subunit consists of at least two heavy chains and a number of intermediate and light chains. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This C-terminal domain carries the D6 region of the dynein motor where the P-loop has been lost in evolution but the general structure of a potential ATP binding site appears to be retained.; Dynein heavy chain, AAA module D4: The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four (D1 - D4) correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two (D5, D6) are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This particular entry represents the D4 ATP-binding domain of the motor.; Dynein heavy chain, ATP-binding dynein motor region: Dyneins are multiprotein complexes that move cargo along microtubules in the minus end direction. The largest component of the dynein complex is the heavy chain. Its C terminus forms the motor unit. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This is the fifth AAA+ domain subdomain AAA5S. Structural analysis reveal that it is the coiled-coil buttress interface. The relative movement of AAA5S together with the stalk (AAA4S), is coupled to rearrangements in the AAA+ ring. Closure of the AAA1 site and the rigid body movement of AAA2-AAA4 force the AAA4/AAA5 interface to close and the AAA6L subdomain to rotate towards the ring centre. The AAA5S subdomain rotates as a unit together with AAA6L, and this movement pulls the buttress relative to the stalk.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain: This family represents the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain. This domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domain.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain, barrel region: Dyneins are microtubule-based AAA motor complexes that power ciliary beating, cell division, cell migration and intracellular transport. The motor domain comprises the AAA ring and three additional structural units: the linker, stalk/strut (both of which are major functional units of the heavy chain) and C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domains. This entry represents the barrel region of the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain, coiled coil stalk: The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules (D1-6), of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This domain occurs between D4 and D5 and includes the two predicted α-helical coiled coil segments that form the stalk supporting the ATP-sensitive microtubule binding component.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.",

These superhelical structures present an extensive solvent-accessible surface that is well suited to binding large substrates such as proteins and nucleic acids. The sequence similarity among these different repeats or domains is low, however they exhibit considerable structural similarity. Furthermore, the number of repeats present in the superhelical structure can vary between orthologues, indicating that rapid loss/gain of repeats has occurred frequently in evolution. A common phylogenetic origin has been proposed for the armadillo and HEAT repeats.; Ras GTPase-activating protein: Ras proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that bind GTP and GDP and slowly hydrolyze GTP to GDP. This intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras is regulated by a family of proteins collectively known as 'GAP' or GTPase-activating proteins. RasGAP proteins are usually quite large (from 765 residues for sar1 to 3079 residues for IRA2) but share only a limited (about 250 residues) region of sequence similarity, referred to as the 'catalytic domain' or RasGAP domain. The most conserved region within this domain contains a 15 residue motif which seems to be characteristic of this family of proteins.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in DYNC2H1; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic; Phenotypes: Jeune thoracic dystrophy; Asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy 3; Dynein heavy chain: Dyneins are described as motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, as they can convert energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to force and move along cytoskeletal polymers, such as microtubules. Dyneins generally contain one to three heavy chains, where each heavy chain consists of a C-terminal globular head, a flexible microtubule-binding stalk, and a flexible N-terminal tail known as the cargo-binding domain. The two categories of dyneins are the axonemal dyneins, which produce the bending motions that propagate along cilia and flagella, and the cytosolic dyneins, which drive a variety of fundamental cellular processes including nuclear migration, organisation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome separation during mitosis, and the positioning and function of many intracellular organelles. Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains.; Dynein heavy chain AAA lid domain: This family represents the AAA lid domain found near the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain AAA lid domain superfamily: Dyneins can be divided into two groups: cytoplasmic dyneins and axonemal dyneins, which are also called ciliary or flagellar dyneins. Dyneins power the beating of cilia and flagella, transport various intracellular cargos and are necessary for mitosis. All dyneins have a 300kDa motor domain consisting of a ring of six AAA domains. ATP hydrolysis in the AAA ring drives the cyclic relocation of a motile element, the linker domain, to generate the force necessary for movement. The cytoplasmic dynein is composed of two identical heavy chains (each >500kDa) and a number of smaller chains. The dynein heavy chain, which belongs to the AAA superfamily of mechanochemical enzymes, is responsible for the motor activities of dynein. The heavy-chain folds into a ring-like head composed of six AAA domains, a stem, and a stalk emerging from the head. The stalk is the microtubule-binding domain with a long coiled-coil structure. The 380kDa recombinant fragment of the C-terminal two-thirds of the Dictyostelium dynein heavy chain maintains microtubule (MT)-activated ATPase activity and drives robust MT sliding, showing that this fragment is the motor domain of the Dictyostelium dynein. This superfamily represents the AAA lid domain found near the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain region D6 P-loop domain: This entry represents the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain. The chain also contains ATPase activity and microtubule binding ability and acts as a motor for the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules. Dynein is also involved in cilia and flagella movement. The dynein subunit consists of at least two heavy chains and a number of intermediate and light chains. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This C-terminal domain carries the D6 region of the dynein motor where the P-loop has been lost in evolution but the general structure of a potential ATP binding site appears to be retained.; Dynein heavy chain, AAA module D4: The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four (D1 - D4) correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two (D5, D6) are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This particular entry represents the D4 ATP-binding domain of the motor.; Dynein heavy chain, ATP-binding dynein motor region: Dyneins are multiprotein complexes that move cargo along microtubules in the minus end direction. The largest component of the dynein complex is the heavy chain. Its C terminus forms the motor unit. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This is the fifth AAA+ domain subdomain AAA5S. Structural analysis reveal that it is the coiled-coil buttress interface. The relative movement of AAA5S together with the stalk (AAA4S), is coupled to rearrangements in the AAA+ ring. Closure of the AAA1 site and the rigid body movement of AAA2-AAA4 force the AAA4/AAA5 interface to close and the AAA6L subdomain to rotate towards the ring centre. The AAA5S subdomain rotates as a unit together with AAA6L, and this movement pulls the buttress relative to the stalk.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain: This family represents the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain. This domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domain.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain, barrel region: Dyneins are microtubule-based AAA motor complexes that power ciliary beating, cell division, cell migration and intracellular transport. The motor domain comprises the AAA ring and three additional structural units: the linker, stalk/strut (both of which are major functional units of the heavy chain) and C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domains. This entry represents the barrel region of the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain, coiled coil stalk: The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules (D1-6), of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This domain occurs between D4 and D5 and includes the two predicted α-helical coiled coil segments that form the stalk supporting the ATP-sensitive microtubule binding component.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in WRN; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Werner syndrome; ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecQ, zinc-binding domain: This domain is the zinc-binding domain of ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecQ.; DEAD/DEAH-box helicase domain: This entry represents the DNA-binding domain at the N-terminal in DEAD/DEAH box helicase and related proteins. This domain also contains motif III (S-A-T) which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities. DEAD-box and DEAH-box RNA helicases are essential enzymes involved in the unwinding of nucleic acids, playing critical roles in RNA metabolism. The DEAD-box helicases, exemplified by the translation initiation factor eIF4A, are RNA-dependent ATPases that act as RNA helicases in conjunction with eIF4B. These proteins participate in a wide range of processes including nuclear transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, nucleocytoplasmic transport, translation, RNA decay and organellar gene expression. In contrast, DEAH-box helicases are primarily involved in pre-mRNA splicing and function as ATP-dependent RNA helicases.; DNA helicase, ATP-dependent, RecQ type: The ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecQ is involved in genome maintenance. All homologues tested to date unwind paired DNA, translocating in a 3' to 5' direction and several have a preference for forked or 4-way DNA structures (e.g. Holliday junctions) or for G-quartet DNA. The yeast protein, Sgs1, is present in numerous foci that coincide with sites of de novo synthesis DNA, such as the replication fork, and protein levels peak during S-phase. A model has been proposed for Sgs1p action in the S-phase checkpoint response, both as a 'sensor' for damage during replication and a 'resolvase' for structures that arise at paused forks, such as the four-way 'chickenfoot' structure. The action of Sgs1p may serve to maintain the proper amount and integrity of ss DNA that is necessary for the binding of RPA (replication protein A, the eukaryotic ss DNA-binding protein)-DNA pol complexes. Sgs1p would thus function by detecting (or resolving) aberrant DNA structures, and would thus contribute to the full activation of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, Mec1p and the effector kinase, Rad53p. Its ability to bind both the large subunit of RPA and the RecA-like protein Rad51p, place it in a unique position to resolve inappropriate fork structures that can occur when either the leading or lagging strand synthesis is stalled. Thus, RecQ helicases integrate checkpoint activation and checkpoint response.; Helicase Helix-turn-helix domain: This presumed domain is found at the C terminus of a large number of helicases, including human Bifunctional 3'-5' exonuclease/ATP-dependent helicase WRN, a multifunctional enzyme that has magnesium and ATP-dependent 3'-5' DNA-helicase activity on partially duplex substrates and also has 3'->5' exonuclease activity towards double-stranded (ds)DNA with a 5'-overhang. Its depletion leads to chromosomal breaks and genome instability.; Helicase superfamily 1/2, ATP-binding domain: This entry represents the DNA-binding domain of classical SF1 and SF2 helicases. It does not recognise bacterial DinG and eukaryotic Rad3 which differ from other SF1-SF2 helicases by the presence of a large insert after the Walker A (see ). Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). All of the proteins bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A (phosphate-binding loop or P-loop) and Walker B (Mg2+-binding aspartic acid) motifs. For the two largest groups, commonly referred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been identified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses that seem to be active as monomers or dimers. RNA and DNA helicases are considered to be enzymes that catalyse the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in an energy-dependent manner. The various structures of SF1 and SF2 helicases present a common core with two α-β RecA-like domains. The structural homology with the RecA recombination protein covers the five contiguous parallel β-strands and the tandem α-helices. ATP binds to the amino proximal α-β domain, where the Walker A (motif I) and Walker B (motif II) are found. The N-terminal domain also contains motif III (S-A-T) which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities. The carboxy-terminal α-β domain is structurally very similar to the proximal one even though it is bereft of an ATP-binding site, suggesting that it may have originally arisen through gene duplication of the first one. Some members of helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 are listed below:; Helicase, C-terminal domain-like: Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). For the two largest groups, commonly referred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been identified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses. This entry represents the C-terminal domain found in proteins belonging to the helicase superfamilies 1 and 2. Included in this group is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), a member of the DEA(D/H)-box RNA helicase family. The structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of eIF4A has been determined; it has a parallel α-β topology that superimposes, with minor variations, on the structures and conserved motifs of the equivalent domain in other, distantly related helicases.; HRDC domain: The HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain is comprised of two orthogonally packed α-hairpin subdomains, and is involved in interactions with DNA and protein. It has been suggested that this domain plays a role dissolving double Holliday junctions efficiently. HRDC domains are found at the C terminus of many RecQ helicases, including the human Bifunctional 3'-5' exonuclease/ATP-dependent helicase WRN and RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM. RecQ helicases have been shown to unwind DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. The structure of the HRDC domain consists of a 4-5 helical bundle of two orthogonally packed α-hairpins, and as such it resembles auxiliary domains in bacterial DNA helicases and other proteins that interact with nucleic acids. A positively charged region on the surface of the HRDC domain is able to interact with DNA. The HRDC domain is also present in eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerase II subunit RBP4, the N-terminal of which forms a heterodimerisation α-hairpin. The HRDC domain has a putative role in nucleic acid binding. Mutations in the HRDC domain associated with the human BLM gene result in Bloom Syndrome (BS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by proportionate pre- and postnatal growth deficiency; sun-sensitive, telangiectatic, hypo- and hyperpigmented skin; predisposition to malignancy; and chromosomal instability.; HRDC-like superfamily: This superfamily represents the HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain, which comprises two orthogonally packed α-hairpin subdomains, and is involved in interactions with DNA and protein. The HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain is found at the C terminus of many RecQ helicases, including the human Bifunctional 3'-5' exonuclease/ATP-dependent helicase WRN and RecQ-like DNA helicase BLM (previously known as Werner and Bloom syndrome proteins). RecQ helicases have been shown to unwind DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. The structure of the HRDC domain consists of a 4-5 helical bundle of two orthogonally packed α-hairpins, and as such it resembles auxiliary domains in bacterial DNA helicases and other proteins that interact with nucleic acids. A positively charged region on the surface of the HRDC domain is able to interact with DNA. The HRDC domain is also present in eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerase II subunit RBP4, the N-terminal of which forms a heterodimerisation α-hairpin.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.; RQC domain: This entry represents the RQC domain, which is a DNA-binding domain found only in RecQ family enzymes. RecQ family helicases can unwind G4 DNA, and play important roles at G-rich domains of the genome, including the telomeres, rDNA, and immunoglobulin switch regions. This domain has a helix-turn-helix structure and acts as a high affinity G4 DNA binding domain. Binding of RecQ to Holliday junctions involves both the RQC and the HRDC domains.; Winged helix DNA-binding domain superfamily: Winged helix DNA-binding proteins share a related winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, where the \"wings\", or loops, are small β-sheets. The winged helix motif consists of two wings (W1, W2), three α-helices (H1, H2, H3) and three β-sheets (S1, S2, S3) arranged in the order H1-S1-H2-H3-S2-W1-S3-W2. The DNA-recognition helix makes sequence-specific DNA contacts with the major groove of DNA, while the wings make different DNA contacts, often with the minor groove or the backbone of DNA. Several winged-helix proteins display an exposed patch of hydrophobic residues thought to mediate protein-protein interactions.; Winged helix-like DNA-binding domain superfamily: Winged helix DNA-binding proteins share a related winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, where the \"wings\", or loops, are small β-sheets. The winged helix motif consists of two wings (W1, W2), three α-helices (H1, H2, H3) and three β-sheets (S1, S2, S3) arranged in the order H1-S1-H2-H3-S2-W1-S3-W2. The DNA-recognition helix makes sequence-specific DNA contacts with the major groove of DNA, while the wings make different DNA contacts, often with the minor groove or the backbone of DNA. Several winged-helix proteins display an exposed patch of hydrophobic residues thought to mediate protein-protein interactions. Many different proteins with diverse biological functions contain a winged helix DNA-binding domain, including transcriptional repressors such as biotin repressor, LexA repressor and the arginine repressor; transcription factors such as the hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 proteins involved in cell differentiation, heat-shock transcription factor, and the general transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIF; helicases such as RuvB that promotes branch migration at the Holliday junction, and CDC6 in the pre-replication complex; endonucleases such as FokI and TnsA; histones; and Mu transposase, where the flexible wing of the enhancer-binding domain is essential for efficient transposition.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in NF1; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Neurofibromatosis, type 1; Armadillo-type fold: This entry represents a structural domain with an armadillo (ARM)-like fold, consisting of a multi-helical fold comprised of two curved layers of α-helices arranged in a regular right-handed superhelix, where the repeats that make up this structure are arranged about a common axis. These superhelical structures present an extensive solvent-accessible surface that is well suited to binding large substrates such as proteins and nucleic acids. The sequence similarity among these different repeats or domains is low, however they exhibit considerable structural similarity. Furthermore, the number of repeats present in the superhelical structure can vary between orthologues, indicating that rapid loss/gain of repeats has occurred frequently in evolution. A common phylogenetic origin has been proposed for the armadillo and HEAT repeats.; CRAL-TRIO lipid binding domain: The CRAL-TRIO domain is a protein structural domain that binds small lipophilic molecules. The domain is named after cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) and TRIO guanine exchange factor. The CRAL-TRIO domain is found in GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and a family of hydrophobic ligand binding proteins, including the yeast SEC14 protein and mammalian retinaldehyde- and alpha-tocopherol-binding proteins. The domain may either constitute all of the protein or only part of it. The structure of the domain in SEC14 proteins has been determined. The structure contains several α helices as well as a β sheet composed of 6 strands. Strands 2,3,4 and 5 form a parallel β sheet with strands 1 and 6 being anti-parallel. The structure also identified a hydrophobic binding pocket for lipid binding.; Neurofibromin, PH domain-like: This entry represents the pleckstrin homology (PH)-like domain of neurofibromin (NF1) and similar sequences from animals and fungi. Neurofibromin is a Ras-specific GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP). Mutations in the gene encoding this protein cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). This domain forms a bipartite module with the Sec14p homologous segment, which together exhibit phospholipid binding activity. The domain interface architecture suggests a model of how the NF1 PH domain may regulate binding of a ligand by the Sec14 module.; PH-like domain superfamily: This superfamily represents the PH domain and structurally related domains. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are small modular domains that occur in a large variety of signalling proteins, where they serve as simple targeting domains that bind lipids. PH domains have a partly opened β-barrel topology that is capped by an α-helix. The structure of PH domains is similar to the phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) found in IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), Shc adaptor and Numb; to the Ran-binding domain, found in Nup nuclear pore complex and Ranbp1; to the Enabled/VASP homology domain 1 (EVH1 domain), found in Enabled, VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein), Homer and WASP actin regulatory protein; and to the third domain of FERM, found in moesin, radixin, ezrin, merlin and talin.; Ras GTPase-activating domain: This entry represents a conserved domain in the RasGAPs (Ras GTPase-activating proteins). This domain is also known as the RasGAP domain. Ras proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that bind GTP and GDP and slowly hydrolyze GTP to GDP. This intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras is regulated by a family of proteins collectively known as 'GAP' or GTPase-activating proteins. RasGAP proteins are usually quite large (from 765 residues for sar1 to 3079 residues for IRA2) but share only a limited (about 250 residues) region of sequence similarity, referred to as the 'catalytic domain' or RasGAP domain. The most conserved region within this domain contains a 15 residue motif which seems to be characteristic of this family of proteins.; Ras GTPase-activating protein: Ras proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that bind GTP and GDP and slowly hydrolyze GTP to GDP. This intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras is regulated by a family of proteins collectively known as 'GAP' or GTPase-activating proteins. RasGAP proteins are usually quite large (from 765 residues for sar1 to 3079 residues for IRA2) but share only a limited (about 250 residues) region of sequence similarity, referred to as the 'catalytic domain' or RasGAP domain. The most conserved region within this domain contains a 15 residue motif which seems to be characteristic of this family of proteins.; Ras GTPase-activating protein, conserved site: This entry represents a conserved site in the RasGAPs (Ras GTPase-activating proteins).; Rho GTPase activation protein: Proteins containing a RhoGAP (Rho GTPase Activating Protein) domain usually function to catalyse the hydrolysis of GTP that is bound to Rho, Rac and/or Cdc42, inactivating these regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. The 53 known human RhoGAP domain-containing proteins are the largest known group of Rho GTPase regulators and significantly outnumber the 21 Rho GTPases they presumably regulate. This excess of GAP proteins probably indicates complex regulation of the Rho GTPases and is consistent with the existence of almost as many (48) human Dbl domain-containing Rho GEFs that act antagonistically to the RhoGAP proteins by activating the Rho GTPases. Phylogenetic analysis offers evidence for frequent domain duplication and for duplication of the entire genes containing these GAP domains.",

         "loss-of-function (premature stop) in DNAH11; Clinical Significance: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Primary ciliary dyskinesia; AAA+ ATPase domain: This entry represents the AAA+ ATPase domain found in a range of proteins, including Holliday junction ATP-dependent DNA helicase RuvB from Mycobacterium sp, ATP synthases, and related ATP-dependent proteins. The proteins in this superfamily are characterised by the structural conservation of a central ATPase domain of about 250 amino acids called the AAA module. Typically, the AAA domain can be divided into two structural subdomains, an N-terminal P-loop NTPase α-β-α subdomain that is connected to a smaller C-terminal all-α subdomain. The α-β-α subdomain adopts a Rossman fold and contains several motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, including classical motifs Walker A and Walker B. The all-α subdomain, is much less conserved across AAA proteins. The AAA+ superfamily of ATPases is found in all kingdoms of living organisms where they participate in diverse cellular processes including membrane fusion, proteolysis and DNA replication. Although the terms AAA+ and AAA are often used loosely and interchangeably, the classical AAA family members are distinguished by their possession of the SRH region in the AAA module. Many AAA+ proteins are involved in similar processes to those of AAA proteins (facilitation of protein folding and unfolding, assembly or disassembly of proteins complexes, protein transport and degradation), but others function in replication, recombination, repair and transcription. For a review see.; Dynein heavy chain: Dyneins are described as motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, as they can convert energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to force and move along cytoskeletal polymers, such as microtubules. Dyneins generally contain one to three heavy chains, where each heavy chain consists of a C-terminal globular head, a flexible microtubule-binding stalk, and a flexible N-terminal tail known as the cargo-binding domain. The two categories of dyneins are the axonemal dyneins, which produce the bending motions that propagate along cilia and flagella, and the cytosolic dyneins, which drive a variety of fundamental cellular processes including nuclear migration, organisation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome separation during mitosis, and the positioning and function of many intracellular organelles. Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains.; Dynein heavy chain 3, AAA+ lid domain: This domain represents the AAA lid domain from dynein heavy chain 3 and related proteins.; Dynein heavy chain AAA lid domain: This family represents the AAA lid domain found near the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain AAA lid domain superfamily: Dyneins can be divided into two groups: cytoplasmic dyneins and axonemal dyneins, which are also called ciliary or flagellar dyneins. Dyneins power the beating of cilia and flagella, transport various intracellular cargos and are necessary for mitosis. All dyneins have a 300kDa motor domain consisting of a ring of six AAA domains. ATP hydrolysis in the AAA ring drives the cyclic relocation of a motile element, the linker domain, to generate the force necessary for movement. The cytoplasmic dynein is composed of two identical heavy chains (each >500kDa) and a number of smaller chains. The dynein heavy chain, which belongs to the AAA superfamily of mechanochemical enzymes, is responsible for the motor activities of dynein. The heavy-chain folds into a ring-like head composed of six AAA domains, a stem, and a stalk emerging from the head. The stalk is the microtubule-binding domain with a long coiled-coil structure. The 380kDa recombinant fragment of the C-terminal two-thirds of the Dictyostelium dynein heavy chain maintains microtubule (MT)-activated ATPase activity and drives robust MT sliding, showing that this fragment is the motor domain of the Dictyostelium dynein. This superfamily represents the AAA lid domain found near the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain region D6 P-loop domain: This entry represents the C-terminal region of dynein heavy chain. The chain also contains ATPase activity and microtubule binding ability and acts as a motor for the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules. Dynein is also involved in cilia and flagella movement. The dynein subunit consists of at least two heavy chains and a number of intermediate and light chains. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This C-terminal domain carries the D6 region of the dynein motor where the P-loop has been lost in evolution but the general structure of a potential ATP binding site appears to be retained.; Dynein heavy chain, AAA 5 extension domain: This entry corresponds to the extension domain of AAA domain 5 in the dynein heavy chain. This domain is composed of 8 α-helices.; Dynein heavy chain, AAA module D4: The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four (D1 - D4) correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two (D5, D6) are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This particular entry represents the D4 ATP-binding domain of the motor.; Dynein heavy chain, AAA1 domain, small subdomain: Dyneins are multiprotein complexes that move cargo along microtubules in the minus end direction. The largest component of the dynein complex is the heavy chain. Its C terminus forms the motor unit. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This domain is the D1 unit of the motor and contains the hydrolytic ATP binding site. Each AAA domain can be subdivided into a \"large\" (AAAL) and a five helix bundle or \"small\" subdomain (AAAS). AAA1L, AAA1S and AAA2L enclose ADP.vanadate (ADP.Vi, ATP-hydrolysis transition state analogue). The AAA1L sensor-I loop, which varies in position depending on dynein's nucleotide state, swings in to contact AAA2L forming the important AAA1 nucleotide-binding site. This entry represents the small subdomain of the AAA1 domain.; Dynein heavy chain, ATP-binding dynein motor region: Dyneins are multiprotein complexes that move cargo along microtubules in the minus end direction. The largest component of the dynein complex is the heavy chain. Its C terminus forms the motor unit. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This is the fifth AAA+ domain subdomain AAA5S. Structural analysis reveal that it is the coiled-coil buttress interface. The relative movement of AAA5S together with the stalk (AAA4S), is coupled to rearrangements in the AAA+ ring. Closure of the AAA1 site and the rigid body movement of AAA2-AAA4 force the AAA4/AAA5 interface to close and the AAA6L subdomain to rotate towards the ring centre. The AAA5S subdomain rotates as a unit together with AAA6L, and this movement pulls the buttress relative to the stalk.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain: This family represents the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain. This domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domain.; Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain, barrel region: Dyneins are microtubule-based AAA motor complexes that power ciliary beating, cell division, cell migration and intracellular transport. The motor domain comprises the AAA ring and three additional structural units: the linker, stalk/strut (both of which are major functional units of the heavy chain) and C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is a complex structure comprising six α-helices and an incomplete six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The shape of this domain is distinctively flat, spreading over the AAA1, AAA5 and AAA6 domains. This entry represents the barrel region of the C-terminal domain of dynein heavy chain.; Dynein heavy chain, coiled coil stalk: The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules (D1-6), of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This domain occurs between D4 and D5 and includes the two predicted α-helical coiled coil segments that form the stalk supporting the ATP-sensitive microtubule binding component.; Dynein heavy chain, domain 2, N-terminal: Dyneins are described as motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, as they can convert energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to force and movement along cytoskeletal polymers, such as microtubules. Dyneins generally contain one to three heavy chains, which belong to the AAA+ superfamily of mechanochemical enzymes. Each heavy chain consists of a flexible N-terminal tail known as the cargo-binding domain and a motor domain which consists of an ATP-hydrolysing AAA+ ring, a flexible microtubule-binding stalk, a linker and a C-sequence. The stalk has an ATP-sensitive microtubule-binding site (MTBD) at its tip, whereas the linker has been suggested to function as a mechanical element for generating dynein's power stroke. The two categories of dyneins are the axonemal dyneins, which produce the bending motions that propagate along cilia and flagella, and the cytosolic dyneins, which drive a variety of fundamental cellular processes including nuclear migration, organisation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome separation during mitosis, and the positioning and function of many intracellular organelles. Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains. This superfamily represents the N-terminal part of the second domain of dynein heavy chain. No function seems to have been attributed specifically to this region.; Dynein heavy chain, hydrolytic ATP-binding dynein motor region: Dyneins are multiprotein complexes that move cargo along microtubules in the minus end direction. The largest component of the dynein complex is the heavy chain. Its C terminus forms the motor unit. The 380kDa motor unit of dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The core of the 380kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This domain is the D1 unit of the motor and contains the hydrolytic ATP binding site. This is the AAA1 large (AAA1L) subdomain with the accompanying small subdomain (AAA1S). AAA1L, AAA1S and AAA2L enclose ADP.vanadate (ADP.Vi, ATP-hydrolysis transition state analogue). The AAA1L sensor-I loop, which varies in position depending on dynein's nucleotide state, swings in to contact AAA2L forming the important AAA1 nucleotide-binding site.; Dynein heavy chain, linker: Dyneins are described as motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, as they can convert energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to force and movement along cytoskeletal polymers, such as microtubules.

This entry represents the linker of the dynein heavy chain motor domain.; Dynein heavy chain, linker, subdomain 3: Dyneins are described as motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, as they can convert energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to force and movement along cytoskeletal polymers, such as microtubules.

Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains. This superfamily represents the subdomain 3 found in the linker domain of dynein heavy chain. The linker exists as a rod-like structure that comprises nineteen α-helices and eight β-strands and can be divided into five subdomains from 0 to 4. This subdomain interacts with subdomain 2 and 4 and has been suggested to play a role in the interactions between the linker base and the ring.; P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase: The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds. The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP.",

The catalytic component of the DNA polymerase epsilon complex is involved in chromosomal DNA replication where it has been shown to participate in leading-strand synthesis. This domain, which makes contacts in the DNA minor groove, shows a mainly α-helical structure.; DNA polymerase epsilon catalytic subunit: DNA polymerase epsilon catalytic subunit (also known as POL2) is a catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon, which is a a high-fidelity polymerase participating in chromosomal DNA replication. It contains both polymerase and 3'-5'-exonuclease domains. Its 3'-5'-exonuclease domain ensures a particularly low error rate. POL2 also plays a role in DNA repair and is linked to cancer. Its structure has been solved.; DNA polymerase epsilon, catalytic subunit A, C-terminal: This domain is found on the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon. It is found C-terminal to and.; DNA polymerase family B, thumb domain: DNA is the biological information that instructs cells how to exist in an ordered fashion: accurate replication is thus one of the most important events in the life cycle of a cell. This function is performed by DNA- directed DNA-polymerases ) by adding nucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) residues to the 5'-end of the growing chain of DNA, using a complementary DNA chain as a template. Small RNA molecules are generally used as primers for chain elongation, although terminal proteins may also be used for the de novo synthesis of a DNA chain. Even though there are 2 different methods of priming, these are mediated by 2 very similar polymerases classes, A and B, with similar methods of chain elongation. A number of DNA polymerases have been grouped under the designation of DNA polymerase family B. Six regions of similarity (numbered from I to VI) are found in all or a subset of the B family polymerases.

    "loss-of-function (frameshift) in LIFR; ClinSig: Pathogenic; Phenotypes: Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome 1; Fibronectin type III: Fibronectin is a dimeric glycoprotein composed of disulfide-linked subunits with a molecular weight of 220-250kDa each. It is involved in cell adhesion, cell morphology, thrombosis, cell migration, and embryonic differentiation. Fibronectin is a modular protein composed of homologous repeats of three prototypical types of domains known as types I, II, and III. Fibronectin type-III (FN3) repeats are both the largest and the most common of the fibronectin subdomains. Domains homologous to FN3 repeats have been found in various animal protein families including other extracellular-matrix molecules, cell-surface receptors, enzymes, and muscle proteins. Structures of individual FN3 domains have revealed a conserved β-sandwich fold with one β-sheet containing four strands and the other sheet containing three strands (see for example ). This fold is topologically very similar to that of Ig-like domains, with a notable difference being the lack of a conserved disulfide bond in FN3 domains. Distinctive hydrophobic core packing and the lack of detectable sequence homology between immunoglobulin and FN3 domains suggest, however, that these domains are not evolutionarily related. FN3 exhibits functional as well as structural modularity. Sites of interaction with other molecules have been mapped to short stretch of amino acids such as the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence found in various FN3 domains. The RGD sequences is involved in interactions with integrin. Small peptides containing the RGD sequence can modulate a variety of cell adhesion invents associated with thrombosis, inflammation, and tumour metastasis. These properties have led to the investigation of RGD peptides and RGD peptide analogues as potential therapeutic agents.; Immunoglobulin-like fold: This superfamily represents domains with an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) fold, which consists of a β-sandwich of seven or more strands in two sheets with a Greek-key topology. Ig-like domains are one of the most common protein modules found in animals, occurring in a variety of different proteins. These domains are often involved in interactions, commonly with other Ig-like domains via their β-sheets. Domains within this fold-family share the same structure, but can diverge with respect to their sequence. Based on sequence, Ig-like domains can be classified as V-set domains (antibody variable domain-like), C1-set domains (antibody constant domain-like), C2-set domains, and I-set domains (antibody intermediate domain-like). Proteins can contain more than one of these types of Ig-like domains. For example, in the human T-cell receptor antigen CD2, domain 1 (D1) is a V-set domain, while domain 2 (D2) is a C2-set domain, both domains having the same Ig-like fold. Domains with an Ig-like fold can be found in many, diverse proteins in addition to immunoglobulin molecules. For example, Ig-like domains occur in several different types of receptors (such as various T-cell antigen receptors), several cell adhesion molecules, MHC class I and II antigens, as well as the hemolymph protein hemolin, and the muscle proteins titin, telokin and twitchin.; Long hematopoietin receptor, Gp130 family 2, conserved site: A number of receptors for lymphokines, hematopoietic growth factors and growth hormone-related molecules have been found to share a common binding domain. These receptors are designated as hematopoietin receptors and the corresponding ligands as hematopoietins. Further, hematopoietins have been subdivided into two major structural groups: Large/long and small/short hematopoietins. One subset of individual receptor chains that are part of receptor complexes for large hematopoietins contain common structural elements in their extracellular parts: an immunoglobulin-like domain, an hematopoietin-receptor domain, and 3 fibronectin type-III domains (2 in the leptin receptor). This subgroup was designated as \"Gp130 family of receptors\" and contains the following chains: Leptin receptor (LPTR), Granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR), Interleukin-6/-11/LIF/OSM/CNTF common beta chain (Gp130), Leukemia inhibiting factor receptor (LIFR), Oncostatin-M receptor beta chain (OSMR), Interleukin-12 receptor beta-1 chain (IL12RB1), Interleukin-12 receptor beta-2 chain (IL12RB2). A schematic representation of the structure of these receptors is shown below: These receptor chains homodimerize (GCSFR, Gp130, LPTR) or heterodimerize (Gp130 with LIFR or OSMR, IL12RB1 with IL12RB2) upon binding of the cognate cytokine: G-CSF, LIF, OSM, LPT, or the cytokine/alpha chain complex: IL-6/IL6RA, IL-11/IL11RA, CNTF/CNTFRA, IL-12 (p35/p40).; Type I Cytokine Receptor: The Type I Cytokine Receptor family is characterized by its role in immune system regulation and hematopoiesis. Members of this family are involved in various signaling pathways, such as JAK/STAT, MAPK, and NOTCH, which lead to diverse biological effects including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and inflammation control. They are receptors for a range of cytokines, including interleukins, growth hormone, prolactin, and leptin, mediating responses like growth regulation, appetite control, and immune cell development. The receptors typically feature a WSXWS motif essential for proper folding and transport, and a box 1 motif necessary for interaction with JAK kinases. Some receptors also exist in soluble forms, acting as agonists or modulators of signaling. This family plays a critical role in both central and peripheral functions, affecting processes from bone metabolism to neural development and regeneration.\n",

      "IPR058129: This group of cysteine peptidases belong to the MEROPS peptidase family C2 (calpain family, clan CA). A type example is calpain, which is an intracellular protease involved in many important cellular functions that are regulated by calcium. The protein is a complex of 2 polypeptide chains (light and heavy), with eleven known active peptidases in humans and two non-peptidase homologues known as calpamodulin and androglobin. These include a highly calcium-sensitive (i.e., micro-molar range) form known as mu-calpain, mu-CANP or calpain I; a form sensitive to calcium in the milli-molar range, known as m-calpain, m-CANP or calpain II; and a third form, known as p94, which is found in skeletal muscle only. All forms have identical light but different heavy chains. Both mu- and m-calpain are heterodimers containing an identical 28kDa subunit and an 80kDa subunit that shares 55-65% sequence homology between the two proteases. The crystallographic structure of m-calpain reveals six \"domains\" in the 80kDa subunit: Calpain-like mRNAs have been identified in other organisms including bacteria, but the molecules encoded by these mRNAs have not been isolated, so little is known about their properties. How calpain activity is regulated in these organisms cells is still unclear In metazoans, the activity of calpain is controlled by a single proteinase inhibitor, calpastatin. The calpastatin gene can produce eight or more calpastatin polypeptides ranging from 17 to 85kDa by use of different promoters and alternative splicing events. The physiological significance of these different calpastatins is unclear, although all bind to three different places on the calpain molecule; binding to at least two of the sites is Ca2+ dependent. The calpains ostensibly participate in a variety of cellular processes including remodelling of cytoskeletal/membrane attachments, different signal transduction pathways, and apoptosis. Deregulated calpain activity following loss of Ca2+ homeostasis results in tissue damage in response to events such as myocardial infarcts, stroke, and brain trauma. Calpains are a family of cytosolic cysteine proteinases (see ). Members of the calpain family are believed to function in various biological processes, including integrin-mediated cell migration, cytoskeletal remodeling, cell differentiation and apoptosis. The calpain family includes numerous members from C. elegans to mammals and with homologues in yeast and bacteria. The best characterised members are the m- and mu-calpains, both proteins are heterodimer composed of a large catalytic subunit and a small regulatory subunit. The large subunit comprises four domains (dI-dIV) while the small subunit has two domains (dV-dVI). Domain dI is a short region cleaved by autolysis, dII is the catalytic core, dIII is a C2-like domain, dIV consists of five calcium binding EF-hand motifs. The crystal structure of calpain has been solved. The catalytic region consists of two distinct structural domains (dIIa and dIIb). dIIa contains a central helix flanked on three faces by a cluster of α-helices and is entirely unrelated to the corresponding domain in the typical thiol proteinases. The fold of dIIb is similar to the corresponding domain in other cysteine proteinases and contains two three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets. The catalytic triad residues (C,H,N) are located in dIIa and dIIb. The activation of the domain is dependent on the binding of two calcium atoms in two non EF-hand calcium binding sites located in the catalytic core, one close to the Cys active site in dIIa and one at the end of dIIb. Calcium-binding induced conformational changes in the catalytic domain which align the active site. This entry represents the whole catalytic domain. A cysteine peptidase is a proteolytic enzyme that hydrolyses a peptide bond using the thiol group of a cysteine residue as a nucleophile. Hydrolysis involves usually a catalytic triad consisting of the thiol group of the cysteine, the imidazolium ring of a histidine, and a third residue, usually asparagine or aspartic acid, to orientate and activate the imidazolium ring. In only one family of cysteine peptidases, is the role of the general base assigned to a residue other than a histidine: in peptidases from family C89 (acid ceramidase) an arginine is the general base. Cysteine peptidases can be grouped into fourteen different clans, with members of each clan possessing a tertiary fold unique to the clan. Four clans of cysteine peptidases share structural similarities with serine and threonine peptidases and asparagine lyases. From sequence similarities, cysteine peptidases can be clustered into over 80 different families. Clans CF, CM, CN, CO, CP and PD contain only one family. Cysteine peptidases are often active at acidic pH and are therefore confined to acidic environments, such as the animal lysosome or plant vacuole. Cysteine peptidases can be endopeptidases, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, dipeptidyl-peptidases or omega-peptidases. They are inhibited by thiol chelators such as iodoacetate, iodoacetic acid, N -ethylmaleimide or p -chloromercuribenzoate. Clan CA includes proteins with a papain-like fold. There is a catalytic triad which occurs in the order: Cys/His/Asn (or Asp). A fourth residue, usually Gln, is important for stabilising the acyl intermediate that forms during catalysis, and this precedes the active site Cys. The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them. One subdomain consists of a bundle of helices, with the catalytic Cys at the end of one of them, and the other subdomain is a β-barrel with the active site His and Asn (or Asp). There are over thirty families in the clan, and tertiary structures have been solved for members of most of these. Peptidases in clan CA are usually sensitive to the small molecule inhibitor E64, which is ineffective against peptidases from other clans of cysteine peptidases. Clan CD includes proteins with a caspase-like fold. Proteins in the clan have an α/β/α sandwich structure. There is a catalytic dyad which occurs in the order His/Cys. The active site His occurs in a His-Gly motif and the active site Cys occurs in an Ala-Cys motif; both motifs are preceded by a block of hydrophobic residues. Specificity is predominantly directed towards residues that occupy the S1 binding pocket, so that caspases cleave aspartyl bonds, legumains cleave asparaginyl bonds, and gingipains cleave lysyl or arginyl bonds. Clan CE includes proteins with an adenain-like fold. The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them. One domain is a bundle of helices, and the other a β-barrel. The subdomains are in the opposite order to those found in peptidases from clan CA, and this is reflected in the order of active site residues: His/Asn/Gln/Cys. This has prompted speculation that proteins in clans CA and CE are related, and that members of one clan are derived from a circular permutation of the structure of the other. Clan CL includes proteins with a sortase B-like fold. Peptidases in the clan hydrolyse and transfer bacterial cell wall peptides. The fold shows a closed β-barrel decorated with helices with the active site at one end of the barrel. The active site consists of a His/Cys catalytic dyad. Cysteine peptidases with a chymotrypsin-like fold are included in clan PA, which also includes serine peptidases. Cysteine peptidases that are N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases are included in clan PB. Cysteine peptidases with a tertiary structure similar to that of the serine-type aspartyl dipeptidase are included in clan PC. Cysteine peptidases with an intein-like fold are included in clan PD, which also includes asparagine lyases.\n"

      "Region: Fibronectin type III, Description: Fibronectin is a dimeric glycoprotein composed of disulfide-linked subunits with a molecular weight of 220-250kDa each. It is involved in cell adhesion, cell morphology, thrombosis, cell migration, and embryonic differentiation. Fibronectin is a modular protein composed of homologous repeats of three prototypical types of domains known as types I, II, and III. Fibronectin type-III (FN3) repeats are both the largest and the most common of the fibronectin subdomains. Domains homologous to FN3 repeats have been found in various animal protein families including other extracellular-matrix molecules, cell-surface receptors, enzymes, and muscle proteins. Structures of individual FN3 domains have revealed a conserved β-sandwich fold with one β-sheet containing four strands and the other sheet containing three strands (see for example ). This fold is topologically very similar to that of Ig-like domains, with a notable difference being the lack of a conserved disulfide bond in FN3 domains. Distinctive hydrophobic core packing and the lack of detectable sequence homology between immunoglobulin and FN3 domains suggest, however, that these domains are not evolutionarily related. FN3 exhibits functional as well as structural modularity. Sites of interaction with other molecules have been mapped to short stretch of amino acids such as the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence found in various FN3 domains. The RGD sequences is involved in interactions with integrin. Small peptides containing the RGD sequence can modulate a variety of cell adhesion invents associated with thrombosis, inflammation, and tumour metastasis. These properties have led to the investigation of RGD peptides and RGD peptide analogues as potential therapeutic agents.\n",
      "Region: Immunoglobulin-like fold, Description: This superfamily represents domains with an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) fold, which consists of a β-sandwich of seven or more strands in two sheets with a Greek-key topology. Ig-like domains are one of the most common protein modules found in animals, occurring in a variety of different proteins. These domains are often involved in interactions, commonly with other Ig-like domains via their β-sheets. Domains within this fold-family share the same structure, but can diverge with respect to their sequence. Based on sequence, Ig-like domains can be classified as V-set domains (antibody variable domain-like), C1-set domains (antibody constant domain-like), C2-set domains, and I-set domains (antibody intermediate domain-like). Proteins can contain more than one of these types of Ig-like domains. For example, in the human T-cell receptor antigen CD2, domain 1 (D1) is a V-set domain, while domain 2 (D2) is a C2-set domain, both domains having the same Ig-like fold. Domains with an Ig-like fold can be found in many, diverse proteins in addition to immunoglobulin molecules. For example, Ig-like domains occur in several different types of receptors (such as various T-cell antigen receptors), several cell adhesion molecules, MHC class I and II antigens, as well as the hemolymph protein hemolin, and the muscle proteins titin, telokin and twitchin.\n",
      "Region: Long hematopoietin receptor, Gp130 family 2, conserved site, Description: A number of receptors for lymphokines, hematopoietic growth factors and growth hormone-related molecules have been found to share a common binding domain. These receptors are designated as hematopoietin receptors and the corresponding ligands as hematopoietins. Further, hematopoietins have been subdivided into two major structural groups: Large/long and small/short hematopoietins. One subset of individual receptor chains that are part of receptor complexes for large hematopoietins contain common structural elements in their extracellular parts: an immunoglobulin-like domain, an hematopoietin-receptor domain, and 3 fibronectin type-III domains (2 in the leptin receptor). This subgroup was designated as \"Gp130 family of receptors\" and contains the following chains: Leptin receptor (LPTR), Granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR), Interleukin-6/-11/LIF/OSM/CNTF common beta chain (Gp130), Leukemia inhibiting factor receptor (LIFR), Oncostatin-M receptor beta chain (OSMR), Interleukin-12 receptor beta-1 chain (IL12RB1), Interleukin-12 receptor beta-2 chain (IL12RB2). A schematic representation of the structure of these receptors is shown below: These receptor chains homodimerize (GCSFR, Gp130, LPTR) or heterodimerize (Gp130 with LIFR or OSMR, IL12RB1 with IL12RB2) upon binding of the cognate cytokine: G-CSF, LIF, OSM, LPT, or the cytokine/alpha chain complex: IL-6/IL6RA, IL-11/IL11RA, CNTF/CNTFRA, IL-12 (p35/p40).\n",
      "Region: Type I Cytokine Receptor, Description: The Type I Cytokine Receptor family is characterized by its role in immune system regulation and hematopoiesis. Members of this family are involved in various signaling pathways, such as JAK/STAT, MAPK, and NOTCH, which lead to diverse biological effects including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and inflammation control. They are receptors for a range of cytokines, including interleukins, growth hormone, prolactin, and leptin, mediating responses like growth regulation, appetite control, and immune cell development. The receptors typically feature a WSXWS motif essential for proper folding and transport, and a box 1 motif necessary for interaction with JAK kinases. Some receptors also exist in soluble forms, acting as agonists or modulators of signaling. This family plays a critical role in both central and peripheral functions, affecting processes from bone metabolism to neural development and regeneration.\n",

Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17189187, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:38653238, PubMed:9840937). Negatively regulates cell division by controlling expression of a set of genes required for this process (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:9840937). One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression (PubMed:12524540, PubMed:17189187). Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (PubMed:12524540). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (PubMed:12524540). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12524540, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17189187, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24652652, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35618207, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36634798, ECO:0000269|PubMed:38653238, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.',\n",

      "{'NAME': 'Cellular tumor antigen p53 (TP53, P53)', 'FUNCTION': 'Multifunctional transcription factor that induces cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis upon binding to its target DNA sequence. Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type. Negatively regulates cell division by controlling expression of a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2. However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2', 'COFACTOR': 'Zn(2+): Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit', 'SUBUNIT': \"Forms homodimers and homotetramers.

Interacts with S100A4; this interaction promotes TP53 degradation. Interacts with BANP (By similarity). Interacts with TTC5/STRAP; the interaction may result in increased mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Interacts with NQO1; this interaction is NADH- dependent, stabilizes TP53 in response to oxidative stress and protects it from ubiquitin-independent degradation by the 20S proteasome. Interacts with DAZAP2 at TP53 target gene promoters; the interaction is triggered by DNA damage and leads to modulation of the expression of a subset of TP53 target genes, reducing DNA damage- induced cell death by limiting the expression of cell death-mediating TP53 target genes.

transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma; Esophageal cancer (ESCR): A malignancy of the esophagus. The most common types are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Cancer of the esophagus remains a devastating disease because it is usually not detected until it has progressed to an advanced incurable stage. - The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry; Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS): An autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome that in its classic form is defined by the existence of a proband affected by a sarcoma before 45 years with a first degree relative affected by any tumor before 45 years and another first degree relative with any tumor before 45 years or a sarcoma at any age. Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. . - The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry; Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC): A non-melanoma skin cancer affecting the head and neck. The hallmark of cutaneous SCC is malignant transformation of normal epidermal keratinocytes. - The gene represented in this entry is involved in disease pathogenesis; Lung cancer (LNCR): A common malignancy affecting tissues of the lung. The most common form of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that can be divided into 3 major histologic subtypes: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell lung cancer. NSCLC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a poor prognosis. - The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry; Papilloma of choroid plexus (CPP): A benign tumor of neuroectodermal origin that generally occurs in childhood, but has also been reported in adults. Although generally found within the ventricular system, choroid plexus papillomas can arise ectopically in the brain parenchyma or disseminate throughout the neuraxis. Patients present with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure including headache, hydrocephalus, papilledema, nausea, vomiting, cranial nerve deficits, gait impairment, and seizures. . - The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry; Adrenocortical carcinoma (ADCC): A malignant neoplasm of the adrenal cortex and a rare childhood tumor. It occurs with increased frequency in patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. . - The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry; Basal cell carcinoma 7 (BCC7): A common malignant skin neoplasm that typically appears on hair-bearing skin, most commonly on sun-exposed areas. It is slow growing and rarely metastasizes, but has potentialities for local invasion and destruction. It usually develops as a flat, firm, pale area that is small, raised, pink or red, translucent, shiny, and waxy, and the area may bleed following minor injury. Tumor size can vary from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. . - Disease susceptibility is associated with variants affecting the gene represented in this entry; Bone marrow failure syndrome 5 (BMFS5): A form of bone marrow failure syndrome, a heterogeneous group of life-threatening disorders characterized by hematopoietic defects in association with a range of variable extra-hematopoietic manifestations. BMFS5 is an autosomal dominant form characterized by infantile onset of severe red cell anemia requiring transfusion. Additional features include hypogammaglobulinemia, poor growth with microcephaly, developmental delay, and seizures. . - The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry', 'EXPRESSION': 'Ubiquitous. Isoforms are expressed in a wide range of normal tissues but in a tissue-dependent manner. Isoform 2 is expressed in most normal tissues but is not detected in brain, lung, prostate, muscle, fetal brain, spinal cord and fetal liver. Isoform 3 is expressed in most normal tissues but is not detected in lung, spleen, testis, fetal brain, spinal cord and fetal liver. Isoform 7 is expressed in most normal tissues but is not detected in prostate, uterus, skeletal muscle and breast. Isoform 8 is detected only in colon, bone marrow, testis, fetal brain and intestine. Isoform 9 is expressed in most normal tissues but is not detected in brain, heart, lung, fetal liver, salivary gland, breast or intestine', 'LOCATIONS': 'Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Nucleus, PML body; Endoplasmic reticulum; Mitochondrion matrix; Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, microtubule organizing center, centrosome; Note=Recruited into PML bodies together with CHEK2; Translocates to mitochondria upon oxidative stress; Translocates to mitochondria in response to mitomycin C treatment; Competitive inhibition of TP53 interaction with HSPA9/MOT-2 by UBXN2A results in increased protein abundance and subsequent translocation of TP53 to the nucleus; Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Note=Predominantly nuclear but localizes to the cytoplasm when expressed with isoform 4; Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Note=Localized mainly in the nucleus with minor staining in the cytoplasm; Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Note=Localized in the nucleus in most cells but found in the cytoplasm in some cells; Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Note=Predominantly nuclear but translocates to the cytoplasm following cell stress; Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Note=Localized mainly in the nucleus with minor staining in the cytoplasm; Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Note=Localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm in most cells; In some cells, forms foci in the nucleus that are different from nucleoli; Cytoplasm', 'DOMAINS': 'The N-terminal and C-terminal disordered regions undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) following homotetramerization and activation. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation or lactylation affect the ability to undergo LLPS; The nuclear export signal acts as a transcriptional repression domain. The TADI and TADII motifs (residues 17 to 25 and 48 to 56) correspond both to 9aaTAD motifs which are transactivation domains present in a large number of yeast and animal transcription factors', 'POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS': \"Acetylation of Lys-382 by CREBBP enhances transcriptional activity. Acetylation of Lys-382 by EP300. Deacetylation of Lys-382 by SIRT1 impairs its ability to induce proapoptotic program and modulate cell senescence. Deacetylation by SIRT2 impairs its ability to induce transcription activation in a AKT-dependent manner. Acetylation at Lys-381 increases stability. Deacetylation at Lys-381 by SIRT6 decreases its stability, thereby regulating cell senescence. Acetylated at Lys-120 by KAT5, KAT6A and KAT8; regulating its ability to induce proapoptotic program; Lactylation by AARS1 prevents ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), thereby inhibiting transcription factor activity; Phosphorylation on Ser residues mediates transcriptional activation. Phosphorylated by HIPK1 (By similarity). Phosphorylation at Ser-9 by HIPK4 increases repression activity on BIRC5 promoter. Phosphorylated on Thr-18 by VRK1, which may prevent the interaction with MDM2. Phosphorylated on Ser-20 by CHEK2 in response to DNA damage, which prevents ubiquitination by MDM2. Phosphorylated on Ser-20 by PLK3 in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis. Phosphorylated on Thr-55 by TAF1, which promotes MDM2-mediated degradation. Phosphorylated on Ser-33 by CDK7 in a CAK complex in response to DNA damage. Phosphorylated on Ser-46 by HIPK2 upon UV irradiation. Phosphorylation on Ser-46 is required for acetylation by CREBBP. Phosphorylated on Ser-392 following UV but not gamma irradiation. Phosphorylated by NUAK1 at Ser-15 and Ser-392; was initially thought to be mediated by STK11/LKB1 but it was later shown that it is indirect and that STK11/LKB1-dependent phosphorylation is probably mediated by downstream NUAK1. It is unclear whether AMP directly mediates phosphorylation at Ser-15. Phosphorylated on Thr-18 by isoform 1 and isoform 2 of VRK2. Phosphorylation on Thr-18 by isoform 2 of VRK2 results in a reduction in ubiquitination by MDM2 and an increase in acetylation by EP300. Stabilized by CDK5-mediated phosphorylation in response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses at Ser-15, Ser-33 and Ser- 46, leading to accumulation of p53/TP53, particularly in the nucleus, thus inducing the transactivation of p53/TP53 target genes. Phosphorylated by DYRK2 at Ser-46 in response to genotoxic stress. Phosphorylated at Ser-315 and Ser-392 by CDK2 in response to DNA- damage. Phosphorylation at Ser-15 is required for interaction with DDX3X and gamma-tubulin. Phosphorylation at Ser-392 regulates its ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation by increasing fluidity of TP53/p53 condensates; Dephosphorylated by PP2A-PPP2R5C holoenzyme at Thr-55. SV40 small T antigen inhibits the dephosphorylation by the AC form of PP2A; May be O-glycosylated in the C-terminal basic region. Studied in EB-1 cell line; Ubiquitinated by MDM2 and SYVN1, which leads to proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitinated by RFWD3, which works in cooperation with MDM2 and may catalyze the formation of short polyubiquitin chains on p53/TP53 that are not targeted to the proteasome. Ubiquitinated by MKRN1 at Lys-291 and Lys-292, which leads to proteasomal degradation. Deubiquitinated by USP10, leading to its stabilization. Ubiquitinated by TRIM24, RFFL, RNF34 and RNF125, which leads to proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitination by TOPORS induces degradation. Deubiquitination by USP7, leading to stabilization. Isoform 4 is monoubiquitinated in an MDM2- independent manner. Ubiquitinated by COP1, which leads to proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation is negatively regulated by CCAR2. Polyubiquitinated by C10orf90/FATS, polyubiquitination is 'Lys-48'-linkage independent and non-proteolytic, leading to TP53 stabilization (By similarity). Polyubiquitinated by MUL1 at Lys-24 which leads to proteasomal degradation. Deubiquitinated by USP3, leading to stabilization. Ubiquitinated by MSL2, promoting its cytoplasmic localization. Also ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXO22)- KDMA4A complex; leading to proteasomal degradation; Monomethylated at Lys-372 by SETD7, leading to stabilization and increased transcriptional activation. Monomethylated at Lys-370 by SMYD2, leading to decreased DNA-binding activity and subsequent transcriptional regulation activity. Lys-372 monomethylation prevents interaction with SMYD2 and subsequent monomethylation at Lys-370. Dimethylated at Lys-373 by EHMT1 and EHMT2. Monomethylated at Lys-382 by KMT5A, promoting interaction with L3MBTL1 and leading to repress transcriptional activity. Dimethylation at Lys-370 and Lys-382 diminishes p53 ubiquitination, through stabilizing association with the methyl reader PHF20. Demethylation of dimethylated Lys-370 by KDM1A prevents interaction with TP53BP1 and represses TP53- mediated transcriptional activation. Monomethylated at Arg-333 and dimethylated at Arg-335 and Arg-337 by PRMT5; methylation is increased after DNA damage and might possibly affect TP53 target gene specificity; Sumoylated with SUMO1. Sumoylated at Lys-386 by UBC9\"}\n"

As part of the UREL complex, plays a key role in ribosome recycling by promoting mono-ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 subunit of the 60S ribosome. Ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 occurs on free 60S ribosomes following ribosome dissociation: it weakens the junction between post-termination 60S subunits and SEC61 translocons, promoting release and recycling of the large ribosomal subunit from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 and subsequent 60S ribosome recycling either take place after normal termination of translation or after ribosome stalling during cotranslational translocation at the endoplasmic reticulum. Within the UREL complex, CDK5RAP3 acts as a substrate adapter that constrains UFL1 ligase activity to mono-ufmylate RPL26/uL24 at 'Lys-134'. The UREL complex is also involved in reticulophagy in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress by promoting ufmylation of proteins such as CYB5R3, thereby promoting lysosomal degradation of ufmylated proteins. Also acts as a regulator of transcription: negatively regulates NF-kappa-B-mediated gene transcription through the control of RELA phosphorylation. Also regulates mitotic G2/M transition checkpoint and mitotic G2 DNA damage checkpoint. Through its interaction with CDKN2A/ARF and MDM2 may induce MDM2-dependent p53/TP53 ubiquitination, stabilization and activation in the nucleus, thereby promoting G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibition of cell proliferation.

A one-residue insertion in the EF5- binding loop prevents the glutamyl residue at the C-terminal end of the loop from serving as the canonical bidentate calcium ligand. EF5 acts as a high-affinity magnesium-binding domain instead (By similarity). Magnesium, may affect dimerization (By similarity). EF5 may bind either calcium or magnesium depending on the context (By similarity)'}"

Ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 occurs on free 60S ribosomes following ribosome dissociation: it weakens the junction between post-termination 60S subunits and SEC61 translocons, promoting release and recycling of the large ribosomal subunit from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 and subsequent 60S ribosome recycling either take place after normal termination of translation or after ribosome stalling during cotranslational translocation at the endoplasmic reticulum. Within the UREL complex, CDK5RAP3 acts as a substrate adapter that constrains UFL1 ligase activity to mono-ufmylate RPL26/uL24 at 'Lys-134'.

       "{'NAME': 'Cellular tumor antigen p53 (TP53, P53)',\n",
       " 'FUNCTION': 'Multifunctional transcription factor that induces cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis upon binding to its target DNA sequence. Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type. Negatively regulates cell division by controlling expression of a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2. However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2',\n",

       " 'DISEASES': 'Note - TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma; Esophageal cancer (ESCR): A malignancy of the esophagus. The most common types are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Cancer of the esophagus remains a devastating disease because it is usually not detected until it has progressed to an advanced incurable stage. - The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry; Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS): An autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome that in its classic form is defined by the existence of a proband affected by a sarcoma before 45 years with a first degree relative affected by any tumor before 45 years and another first degree relative with any tumor before 45 years or a sarcoma at any age. Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. . - The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry; Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC): A non-melanoma skin cancer affecting the head and neck. The hallmark of cutaneous SCC is malignant transformation of normal epidermal keratinocytes. - The gene represented in this entry is involved in disease pathogenesis; Lung cancer (LNCR): A common malignancy affecting tissues of the lung. The most common form of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that can be divided into 3 major histologic subtypes: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell lung cancer. NSCLC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a poor prognosis. - The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry; Papilloma of choroid plexus (CPP): A benign tumor of neuroectodermal origin that generally occurs in childhood, but has also been reported in adults. Although generally found within the ventricular system, choroid plexus papillomas can arise ectopically in the brain parenchyma or disseminate throughout the neuraxis. Patients present with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure including headache, hydrocephalus, papilledema, nausea, vomiting, cranial nerve deficits, gait impairment, and seizures. . - The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry; Adrenocortical carcinoma (ADCC): A malignant neoplasm of the adrenal cortex and a rare childhood tumor. It occurs with increased frequency in patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. . - The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry; Basal cell carcinoma 7 (BCC7): A common malignant skin neoplasm that typically appears on hair-bearing skin, most commonly on sun-exposed areas. It is slow growing and rarely metastasizes, but has potentialities for local invasion and destruction. It usually develops as a flat, firm, pale area that is small, raised, pink or red, translucent, shiny, and waxy, and the area may bleed following minor injury. Tumor size can vary from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. . - Disease susceptibility is associated with variants affecting the gene represented in this entry; Bone marrow failure syndrome 5 (BMFS5): A form of bone marrow failure syndrome, a heterogeneous group of life-threatening disorders characterized by hematopoietic defects in association with a range of variable extra-hematopoietic manifestations.

Isoform 4 is monoubiquitinated in an MDM2- independent manner. Ubiquitinated by COP1, which leads to proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation is negatively regulated by CCAR2. Polyubiquitinated by C10orf90/FATS, polyubiquitination is 'Lys-48'-linkage independent and non-proteolytic, leading to TP53 stabilization (By similarity). Polyubiquitinated by MUL1 at Lys-24 which leads to proteasomal degradation. Deubiquitinated by USP3, leading to stabilization. Ubiquitinated by MSL2, promoting its cytoplasmic localization. Also ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXO22)- KDMA4A complex; leading to proteasomal degradation; Monomethylated at Lys-372 by SETD7, leading to stabilization and increased transcriptional activation. Monomethylated at Lys-370 by SMYD2, leading to decreased DNA-binding activity and subsequent transcriptional regulation activity. Lys-372 monomethylation prevents interaction with SMYD2 and subsequent monomethylation at Lys-370. Dimethylated at Lys-373 by EHMT1 and EHMT2. Monomethylated at Lys-382 by KMT5A, promoting interaction with L3MBTL1 and leading to repress transcriptional activity. Dimethylation at Lys-370 and Lys-382 diminishes p53 ubiquitination, through stabilizing association with the methyl reader PHF20. Demethylation of dimethylated Lys-370 by KDM1A prevents interaction with TP53BP1 and represses TP53- mediated transcriptional activation. Monomethylated at Arg-333 and dimethylated at Arg-335 and Arg-337 by PRMT5; methylation is increased after DNA damage and might possibly affect TP53 target gene specificity; Sumoylated with SUMO1. Sumoylated at Lys-386 by UBC9\"}"
